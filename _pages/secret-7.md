7: And are we going to do anything regarding Lucielle Johnson?

2: So eager to kill a god?

7: He's responsible for the Trial of Heroes. That means he was the one who put Velvet there, and the one who led Lady Parhelion to the trials. He set all this in motion.

2: Hasty to draw judgement.

7: He's also watched the death of many, many people. He's more than a trickster, he's malicious. He needs to be removed from the equation.

2: He saved Yez's life.

7: And he tortured that one lady on the observatory you puppeted. Did you really think he didn't know you were within that body?

2: Perhaps, perhaps not.

7: Even if he didn't, he was torturing an innocent life.

2: Or he was simply observing such things.

7: Is that any better? If you watch a man die like that, do you really deserve to be blameless? Besides, I didn't expect you to actually defend him this much.

2: The affairs of the gods are tricky, Preston. I didn't even get a chance to face off with Baumen and I was still nearly killed. I fear that you are walking down the same path, and I'd rather not put the most powerful being as your next target.

7: Well, he won't be my target, now will he?

2: You think Parhelion will do the dirty work for you? Are you kidding me?

7: Don't play dumb, I can feel her rage. She wants justice, and not just for Velvet. She wants to kill Lucielle Johnson, or at least beat him down into a lesser position among the gods.

2: We donâ€™t fight gods. Not even the Chaotics do such a thing.

7: But they could. Why not us? We can work together, set traps in advance, take Lucielle Johnson down for good.

2: What do you even care about this realm? Has sense escaped your mind? Just because our story is woven with the drifters does not mean we need to kill their gods.

7: If we don't, then they'll keep coming back to play as Lucielle's pawns. Someone is controlling their souls behind the lines, you know that. Remove the head, and they go free.

2: You know I am with you on this, but I must remain as impartial towards the judgement of the gods as possible. It is the task that I will soon fill.

7: Just go talk to Lady about it. Put out the call.

2: I will ask. Standby.

9: I've thought about it for quite a few years now, Preston. Our first priority, as you well know, is Spailascor. Afterwards, I will issue a call to the Nine with the request to hunt Lucielle Johnson.

7: I'm in.

9: Prices will be negotiated once we are closer to that day.

2: I don't think any of us want a reward in return for this one. Call it a greater evil we're removing.

7: I'm with Tai. I don't see how we can let such a being live this way. His evil is too great.

9: Then it is settled. After we kill Spailascor and free the others, we will return with the intent to capture and try Lucielle Johnson in the Court of the Red Monk, either overseen by Tai or her father.

2: I will gladly judge.

7: I'll deliver the memo when next I see him. Give him a bit of a headstart.
