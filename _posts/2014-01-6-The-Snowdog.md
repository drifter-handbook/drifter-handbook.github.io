## The Snowdog
Campaign: Fly By Night

### Description

The Blue Chaotic, ruler of Niflheim and leader of the Scholars of the Northern lights. He is often well-armed, owning two immensly powerful blades as well as his mighty trident. Beyond this, the Snowdog also wears a magical cloak which allows him to shapeshift. He wove the cloak together over three years, sewing together animal pelts and imbuing his strongest magics into their furs. They say he spends more time in beastskin then as an aged man, and that his appearence can change from year to year as he forgets what he looks like. While uncouth, he is often portrayed as a genius.


### Mythos

The last of the Chaotics to be called to arms. He fights for the protection of life, and the pursuit of knowledge, but most importantly to keep Bytor at bay. Raised as a lowly huntsman, The Snowdog often harasses his enemies by ambushing them in the forests in guise, and seldom returns to his throne. He rules Niflheim but only oversees the Scholars of the Northern Lights. The rest of the enclave is run by his love, Lady Starlight. 

The Snowdog wields two blades, both bastard swords. The first is the blue disgraced blade. It stands at four feet, and its stone stores thirty souls. The second blade is Freyrstav, the King of all Swords. He is a sentient frostblade, found by Snowdog and assisting him throughout his ventures. As of the past two years, he has been gone. 

The Snowdog is a good and understanding man, and the most forgiving of the Chaotics. However, he is also the most regretful, and the one with the most to lose. He is appears the most mortal of the Chaotics, but is considered the most dangerous because of it. The Snowdog's greatest strengths lies with his aid from allies and his people, and his ability to think quickly and rationally to win every battle. He is undefeated in every regard, even against the demon Bytor. The few failures he has seen have yet to come to fruition.

He has one daughter, Lady Parhelion, who leads the Nine.

### Drifters

The Snowdog chose Mytharious Orthello Casimer II and Savvy to represent him among the Drifters. The Snowdog was quite hospitable to the Drifters up in the far north, giving them coats and winter supplies to survive the weather, as well as instructing the stablemaster to give the Drifters winter wolves as mounts. Sebastion and the Scholars of the Northern Lights are known followers of the Snowdog.
