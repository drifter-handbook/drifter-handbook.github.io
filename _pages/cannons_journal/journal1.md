## Drifter Cannon's Hitlist

To whoever reads this,

Having traveled across the continent to reach Freshtovia, I have seen a great many horrors, from the mutated Fry Fiends of the Ice Jester's kingdom, to the hunger pangs that terrorize every nation on the continent. Yet, I have seen nothing quite as monstrous as the four heads of the Freshtovian secret police.

These four individuals have long since abandoned their humanity and dedicated themselves to the enslavement and slaughter of countless civilians, both in Freshtovia and abroad. They are wholeheartedly dedicated to preserving Queen Wendy's absolute dominion over her country and expanding her reach across the continent.

I have dedicated my life to tracking them so that I may one day kill them. Only when they are dead can the Freshtovian people be freed.
