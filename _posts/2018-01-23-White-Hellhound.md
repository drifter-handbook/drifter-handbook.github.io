## The White Hellhounds
Campaign: Fly By Night 

### Description

The bane of every Ysgaardian's existence, and the bulk of By-Tor's armies, the White Hellhound is a symbol of power, laziness, and the inescapable danger of the North. Originally decended from the demon Garm, White Hellhounds are now watered-down versions of normal hellhounds, both for better and for worse. White Hellhounds lack most of the fiery abilities of their kin, but retain their immunity to fire, and trade for impressive survivability skills. While a White Hellhound is weaker than its counterpart, it can survive being blinded, shot, or maimed in nearly any fashion and still retain some semblence of life and the desire to maul whoever draws near.

It is for this reason why most resemble zombified, melting versions of hellhounds. White Hellhounds that survive for more than a few months have often been through many fights, and are crippled in some way or another. They fight with a blind fury, trying to rip apart whoever or whatever comes near. When they inevitably fall apart, it's only a matter of time before some demon picks up the bones and stitches them back together.

The Demon Lord By-Tor typically takes it upon himself to do such a task. Having failed in creating a subserviant army of his children, his backup is an army of the never-dying hellhounds. After his armies have been wiped, By-Tor returns to the field and gathers up the corpses of his White Hellhounds, throwing them into vats of fat at his fortress, and ordering his obedient sons to stir day and night until the White Hellhound bones and fur bind with the flesh and emerge once more. A little is lost in the process each time, but By-Tor's army never seems to shrink or weaken.

### Drifters

Throughout their time in the North, the Drifters encountered several White Hellhounds in their travels, as they are one of the most prevelant threats in the North.

Their first exposure was outside of the City of Nida, where thousands of White Hellhound bones and corpses were scattered, carpetting the landscape far as the eye could see. By-Tor's constant failed attacks against the city created this heap of bodies, and though the area remained a threat, all grow used to it.

Occasionally, the Drifters would find a stray White Hellhound on their travels. At first, these battles proved to be concerning, as White Hellhounds are not creatures to be dismissed for being a common sight. But, the citizens of the North were often around to help dispose of the beasts, and even other dogs such as Bayden were well-equipped to dispose of the creatures in one fell swoop.

The only time the Drifters came face-to-face with a White Hellhound they could not evade or have someone else kill, was with a blinded Hellhound outside the Auracario mountains.
