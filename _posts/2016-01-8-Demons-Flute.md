## Demon's Flute
Campaign: Fly By Night

### Details

A powerful relic created by By-Tor and gifted to Dyo. The pipes are dented and rusted, held together by a black cord. Only one of the pipes appears to produce any sound. When activated, the cord holding the flute together melts into a tar-like substance which is extremely hot to the touch.


### Effect

Ranna (Lv 1):
As an action, the user can cast Sleep on any single enemy without expending any spellslots or requiring the spell in the user's spelllist. However, if the spell succeeds, an ally will fall asleep as well (decided by the DM).

Restored Relic:
This artifact cannot be destroyed.

Blue Bane:
The bearer of this artifact has +2 to hit and +2 damage against any Blue enemies.

### Feats

Originally belonged to Dyo back in the Drachend arc.

Restored and corrupted by By-Tor, as a gift to Dyo.
