## Rammstein and Heinrich

Campaign: Illumina

### Personality

The twin goblin holymen Rammstein and Heinrich VanHalen are characterized by their devotion to faith and fitness. Indoctrinated into the church-business known as The Children of the Trident at a very early age, the inseparable pair have devoted their lives to spreading the good word of the Goddess Evra and sculpting their bodies.  

Only Rammstein will talk to others; on the rare occasion Heinrich does speak, it is in a whispered tone directly to his partner.  Patient, stubborn, and self-centered, the pair is exceedingly vain. Their interactions, both with each other and the world at large, are frequently accented with flexing and grunts. In almost any situation, the conversation will be steered towards their faith, their philosophies on the body, or the “essential oils” they insist is the key to both.

On the very rare occasion the two are forced apart, Rammstein has been known to become impatient, vindictive, and listless. In Rammstein’s absence Heinrich becomes aggressive and anxious, readily assaulting any who encroach on his unspoken boundaries.


### Description

As Evra is a goddess of pleasure in all its forms, her followers are quite diverse in their interpretation of her teachings. Rammstein and Heinrich find the greatest pleasure in pushing their bodies to their limits. Contrasting the usually short stature of goblins, both members of the pair stand at well over six feet tall. Their bodies are heavily muscled and scarred from two decades of constant self-inflicted abuse. Even in the cold of the Theamin Isles, the two abstain from wearing more than their training pants and footwraps. Almost every inch of their exposed skin save for the faces are tattooed with excerpts from Evra’s holy texts. These scriptures act as an arcane focus, and when the two coordinate their movements they are able to empower their spells with their raw physical strength. Together the pair act as a single individual, moving with an almost otherworldly harmony; it is as each knows the others movements before they are made. As the texts are shared between the two, when apart they are unable to cast spells at all.
