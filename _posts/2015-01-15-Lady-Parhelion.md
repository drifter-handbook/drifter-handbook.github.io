## Lady Parhelion

### 9/9

<This character is still in use, and bio will be updated as more information emerges>

Campaign: All (First appeared in Drachend)

### Personality
A sweet, innocent lass with a flair for flashy spells and music. Lady Parhelion steps in to help nearly anyone, and shows great lenghs of mercy to her enemies. A musician by trade, Lady Parhelion is known for her obsessive nature: continuously practicing and honing her music in whatever way possible. Because of her quest to master the harp, she often finds herself dogging heroes around for inspiration, and occassionally aiding them as well. While she can be seen as overly polite at times, she has been known to snap into an intenser state when driven into difficult situations. She appears to be highly logical and coordinated when she chooses to be. During end of the Drachend arc, she was also seen as being a bit more of a daredevil, going to great lengths to save innocent lives.

### Description

Lady Parhelion is a very young human bard. She is short in statue with long hair that reaches past her knees, often tressed up with metal ornaments. Her bardic robes are large and envelop her, making her appear unfit for combat. Her hands are blistered and bloodied from her obsessive harp playing, though her face, arms, and legs appear to have an almost unnatural state of perfect skin. She summons purple transluscent magehands to aid in tasks and to play the harp while she weilds it like a bludgeoning weapon in combat. She has a very precise and practiced attack style, and bashes enemies with her harp with a deceptive strength. She shares spellsets with a cleric, proficient in several types of healing magic as well as offensive spells. 

### Story

Lady Parhelion's past is largely unknown. While she joined the group with her harp in tow, she has stated that she is not familiar much with the instrument and does not care for it. She is also known to wield the harp closer to a melee weapon than as a true bardic weapon.

She has admitted to Gloria that to die now would be unthinkable, and as such Lady Parhelion was unable to sacrifice herself at the Trial of Heroes. It was implied by their talks that Lady Parhelion had a great number of friends in peril, and that it had fallen on her shoulders to save them.

The Lantern Carrier later clarified that the group to which Lady Parhelion had referred to was the Nine of the North, a band of "heroes" to which herself, Lady Parhelion, Reed, Felicia, Sharyn Anne, and Mac were all a part of. The Lantern Carrier named Lady Parhelion as their leader, and the two appear to share a history together. The Lantern Carrier's account also confirms that Lady Parhelion had attempted to free her from some sort of imprisonment by writing the song used against the Jade Fortress. During its performance, however, the Lantern Carrier was not freed.

### Drifters

Part of the Drachend group during the Drachend arc, Lady Parhelion first took action in the streets of the Capitol City by attempting to intimidate a gang of street thugs who had jumped the party. After being backed up by the much more intimidating tiefling Gloria, Lady Parhelion showed great gratitude towards the woman. Gloria would later save Lady Parhelion from a gelatinous cube beneath the city. Lady Parhelion kept a vial of the cube's remains out of spite (Song: "I've Got A Vial of Murderous Goo").

During the visit to the Maldova Estate, Lady Parhelion spent most of her time during the day playing with the children at the estate. She also expressed great interest in learning the song played in the ballroom (Song: "Sweet Memory, Bitter Memory"). After hearing rumors from the family regarding a mysterious song that played through the woods at night, she sought to stay up and listen to the melody while the other members of the party urged otherwise. Once night fell and the chaos began, Lady Parhelion entertained the ghost daughter's wish to play hide-and-seek. Throughout the manor, Lady Parhelion managed to spare three of the house's members (putting the eldest daughter down with a Sleep spell, bringing the group around the grandmother without confrontation, and using spare the dying on the butler after the party laid a killing blow). 

Before the Trial of Heroes, Lady Parhelion expressed great admiration at Fini the archer for her fantastic shots at the wolves outside the trial (Song: Sharpshooter's Shrubbery). When confronted with Velvet for the first time, Lady Parhelion's demeanor changed rather drastically, losing her light-spirited nature and instead becoming very concerned with why Velvet was locked up underground, and whom she reffered to as "her masters". As the group began to approach the final room, they stalled outside the door, unsure of whether or not to proceed. After learning that Velvet would not get to leave should they not open the final door, Lady Parhelion asked the party to procede further. Once the final trial was revealed, Lady Parhelion was the first to volunteer herself to die, but later retracted the offer after slipping into her much more logical state. She spent a great deal of time arguing with Gloria (who was arguing to give up her own life), making the argument that if Velvet had been put here for the trial, Velvet had a better chance of living through the final puzzle than any of the drifters. After swaying the others to her side, Lady Parhelion borrowed a <a href="https://drifter-handbook.github.io/parhelion9" >knife</a> from Fini and offered to be the one to kill Velvet, should Velvet still be willing to give up her life for them. Velvet agreed and refused to turn around when Lady Parhelion asked, wanting to be killed like a hero. Lady Parhelion convinced her to turn around and close her eyes, however, and Lady Parhelion drove Fini's knife into her neck with a painless killing blow (this injury later appeared on Violet corpses at the second Trial's coming). Lady Parhelion carried Velvet's body out afterwards and the party gave her a proper burial in the forest nearby.

In a series of side "support" stories that were part of a RP mechanic offered by the DM, Lady Parhelion and Gloria had a lengthy conversation about the history of tieflings which later sidled into addressing the events of the Trial of Heroes. Lady Parhelion showed a great deal of cordiality towards Gloria, apologizing for being so insistent that Gloria not die, but also reaffirming that Gloria was as equally innocent as Velvet was to her eyes. Gloria also returned the sentiment, and the two learned that they shared similar views on the matter. Lady Parhelion also explained that she had been ready to die in Velvet's stead, but could not due to the fact that she was on a mission to save her friends. Alone in her quest, Lady Parhelion feared that should she die, the others would perish as well. Lady Parhelion asked Gloria to carry a letter on her behalf with the details on her past with the Nine of the North, hoping that should she die in battle that Gloria at least could find someone to help those Lady Parhelion had left behind. Gloria, in exchange, gave Lady Parhelion a small multicolored orb out of a display of friendship. Lady Parhelion carried this trinket with her everywhere thereafter, and Gloria carried the sealed letter.

In the final act of the Drachend arc, the group approached a town where several men were being hanged for being Drachend soldiers. The group watched three of the men hang before Lady Parhelion stepped in to take action, asking Patrick's sorcerer to turn invisible and save the man while she caused distraction (an action later referenced by Lantern Carrier and Valyran in the Ashen Arc). Before casting her spell, Lady Parhelion donned a white mask in the shape of a draconic dog, and with the diversion (Song: Interception), the group was able to save the soldier without further bloodshed. While hiding out in the woods, the soldier was rather taken aback by the drifters, especially when all undressed simultaneously when told that the man needed new clothing. While plans were being set in place to infiltrate the Jade Fortress later, Lady Parhelion offered to be the distraction for the whole endeavor and perform at the gates, with Gloria nearby to fend off attackers as they came in.

During the heist on the Jade Fortress, Lady Parhelion was laughed away at the gates before starting her song. Using an intensified level of thumaturgy, her steps caused tremors in the earth as she danced about, slowly dismantling the crudly-constructed fortress (Song: Red Jade). Her dancing allowed her to avoid most ranged attacks, while Gloria ran interception and kept the ground soldiers away from her. Once the heist was completely pulled off, the general and several veteran soldiers emerged from the gates and set upon Lady Parhelion and Gloria. Gloria grabbed Lady Parhelion and tried to complete their escape, but Lady Parhelion broke away and stood her ground against the soldiers. After a short prayer to the "Daughters of Flowers", Lady Parhelion released a devastating blast of magic that completely destroyed the Jade Fortress, burying all the soldiers and herself under the rubble. Gloria rushed in to rescue a paralyzed Lady Parhelion, who had been kept alive through a strange set of magical runes that had appeared before she was killed. The group rebanded and set sail away from Drachend, reuniting the refuges from the Jade Fortress with their families. 

Lady Parhelion later made an appearance in another oneshot, where she was tasked with finding and destoying an underground organization of theives. Throughout the adventure, Lady Parhelion was shown to be quite a bit more clever and mischevious than her prior Drachend self, mocking the government in town and shrugging off severe injuries with jest and flirtation. Lady Parhelion saved the lives of several of the thieves who ambushed her and the party in the sewers (Song: Pieceful Negotiations), a mercy which allowed the party to make a deal with the theif queen without betraying their original employer.

It is unknown how Lady Parhelion ties in with the drifters as a whole. The members of the Nine appear to know the events that she took part in.
