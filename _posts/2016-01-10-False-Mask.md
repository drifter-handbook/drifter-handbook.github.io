## False Mask
Campaign: Fly By Night

### Details

A powerful relic created by the Snowdog and gifted to Savvy. The mask appears to be made from porcelain and is lined with fur, but is surprisingly sturdy and easy to wear. When activated, an "X" appears above the user's head.


### Effect

False Voice (Lv 1):
Whenever the user casts a music-based spell, roll a d20. On an 18 or above, the spell is cast twice at no cost to the user.

Restored Relic:
This artifact cannot be destroyed.

Green Bane:
The bearer of this artifact has +2 to hit and +2 damage against any Green enemies.

### Feats

A mask which appears to fit in with the masks which the Nine of the North wear. This one appears to be a replica.

Crafted and enchanted by the Snowdog, as a gift to Savvy.
