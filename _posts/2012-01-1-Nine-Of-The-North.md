## The Nine of the North

- - - - - - -

### The children of the Chaotics, joined together in an alliance spearheaded by Lady Parhelion. Their reasons for joining the Drifters are unclear. All but Lady Parhelion use false names when serving with the Drifters. Each has been soft-spoken about the organization, shedding little information as to what it is or what it entails.
