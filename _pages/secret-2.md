2: I think it's about high-time they had an emblem of their own, don't you?

7: I thought I was drawing these for posterity. Since when do we go around handing out titles and symbols?

2: Not used to the idea that you're a drifter yet? You speak as though you are not one of them.

7: An animal, a number, a color, a sigil, a beast, and a title. You want to add more to our names?

2: No matter the outcome of this fight, you can no longer deny that we are alone here, you understand that? We go home, we live or die… Our story is now heavily entwined with the drifters. We are they, and they are an inseverable part of where we are and what we have become.

7: I'll draw something up.

2: Not bad. If only your handwriting looked half as nice.

7: Two cresting waves or tree roots, dependent on how you look. Divided at the base, severed from each other as they always are, but always joined just around the edges. 

2: Disunity as a guise for unity.

7: How poetic. I just couldn’t think of anything other than that dumb tree that keeps popping up, and hey, the fact that I might have drowned a couple days ago.

2: And a sun in the middle?

7: Lest we forget why we're here.
