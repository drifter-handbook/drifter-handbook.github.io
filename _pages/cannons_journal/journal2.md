## George Foreman, head of ~~Truth and Ideas~~ Propaganda

The division of Truth and Ideas is Queen Wendy's propaganda division, monitoring and reporting any dissent that occurs either in Freshtovia or its slave colonies. How it operates is kept as a closely guarded secret, but the mandatory installation of "air fresheners" in every building seems to indicate that George Foreman is keeping the Freshtovian people in line using a slow-acting psychoactive agent.

Foreman's division is known to secretly arrest anyone with dissenting ideas and gather them in "re-education" camps. The few that return are completely loyal to Queen Wendy and her nation, with no trace of their original personality left. When I talked to the children of a man that was taken by Foreman's division, they forcefully denied that he had ever existed.

Foreman is also in charge of keeping the people of Freshtovia unaware of Freshtovia's actions abroad, such as its invasion and subsequent enslavement of the Machine nations.
