## Chilo Vambrace
Campaign: Fly By Night

### Details

A powerful relic created by the Gold Master and gifted to Jester Klatz. The entire arm has been made of a flawless gold, replacing even the sinew and blood of the original arm with molten metal. When activated,the centipede engraving around the forearm comes to life and wraps itself outwards into a long, segmented whip.


### Effect

Chilo Whip (Lv1): Player's base whip attack now deals 1d6 damage. For every successful hit, roll 1d20. On a 15+, the whip also becomes wrapped around the enemy as a setup for Barbed Retort.

Barbed Retort (Lv1): If an enemy is held with the Chilo Whip at the beginning of the player's turn, Barbed Retort can be used as an action instead. Centipede-like legs erupt from the whip and puncture any held units, dealing 2d4 damage and applying a basic poison (AC 10 Con save, 1d4 poison damage for every failed save on subsequent turns until pass). Barbed Retort does not require the user to roll to hit, but cannot be used on the same target on subsequent turns.

Dangerous Gamble (Lv 1) - When dealing poison with the Chilo Vambrace, you can attempt to add 1d4 poison damage to the attack by rolling a d20. On a 15+, the damage is applied. On <15, you receive that damage.

He's Got A Point (Lv 1) - +1 to persuasion rolls

Vagabond (Lv 1): Once per session, you can attempt to open a portal into Solidago's Workshop using A R T. Roll a d20, on a nat 20 the door opens.

Restored Relic:
This artifact cannot be destroyed.

Red Bane:
The bearer of this artifact has +4 to hit and +4 damage against any Blue enemies.

### Feats
Jester Klatz originally entered the North unaligned to any of the Chaotics, but won favor with the Gold Master by accomplishing tasks at Kyurikom's Tower, the Misted Forest, Moosejaw Arena, and Auracario Mountain. In order to create the artifact, the Gold Master placed a gauntlet cast on Jester's right arm that slowly poisoned and withered away his old arm.

Crafted by the Gold Master, as a gift to Jester Klatz.
