## Chapter Three

## To Meet Again

### Three Days Later

### Public Park

Lucille is sitting on a bench watching the birds fly around while rummaging around his briefcase of healing potions and singing a few lines from "Bee Wars." Nero is walking through the park with his friend Bojo. He watches as they pass him by. "N-Nero..." Lucille said.

"Hm?" Nero asked. He stops walking and looks at him. "Oh, it's you, the pervert." Bojo stops walking and looks at Nero confused.

"N-Nero-chan?" Bojo asked. Nero looks at Bojo briefly and then back at Lucille. The man blushes a deep red.

"I got you something," Lucille said.

"Huh?" Nero asked.

"Aww Nero-chan!" Bojo proclaimed. Lucille stands up, picks up a necklace of wolfs' teeth, and hands them to Nero. The dark-haired girl glares at Bojo. Bojo nudges Nero lightly. "Come on; take them, Nero-chan."

"Idiot, you're such a pervert," Nero said. Lucille holds the necklace out to Nero again; he takes them and blushes slightly.

"You're welcome," Lucille said smiling. Nero and Bojo start walking again. Lucille watches as they walk away and slowly starts singing a song from "XCOM: The Bureau Declassified." Nero looks back at Lucille and then at the teeth in his hand.

"Hm... He must be the new singer. I hate them... They are weak." Nero said smugly. Nero throws the teeth in the garbage.

"N-Nero-chan!" Bojo said shocked. He stops singing his song after seeing that Nero has thrown the teeth away. "I especially hate XCOM: The Bureau Declassified."

"But N-Nero... he hasn't done anything wrong..."

"I don't care!" Lucille stands, puts his hands in his pockets, lowers his head and sulks on the way home.

"But he hasn't..."

"Not yet... He'll get an ego just like the other immortals..."

### Lucille's House

#### Neo-Tokyo, Japan

Lucille returns home, his head down; he opens the front door and walks inside closing the door behind him. He walks down the hall before running into his younger sister, Sunny. "What's wrong, Nii-san?" his sister asked.

"Nothing..." he answered.

"Yeah sure if you say so." She skips up the stairs and goes to her room.

### The Park

"Nero, you should apologize..." Bojo said slowly. Nero's cell phone rings as his younger brother calls him.

"Hey bro... yeah..." Nero said with a sigh. "All rightâ€¦" Nero hangs up his phone.

"Hm?"

"Skozz is hungry. Our parents are too busy for us again... and he can't cook." As Lucille sulks in his room, Nero looks at the teeth at the top of the garbage can, then turns away and heads home with Bojo following.
