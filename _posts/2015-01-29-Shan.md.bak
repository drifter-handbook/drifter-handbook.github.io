## Logan the Luck-Touched

8/9

Campaign: Fly By Night

### Personality

One of the younger, but most powerful, members of the Nine of the North. Logan's sorcery skills already place him into a bracket of his own when it comes to combat, but his real strengths lie in his inexplicable ability to have everything work out in his favor. While most of his brothers have suffered due to their demonic status, Logan thrives as a half-demon, and leverages his inherited abilities to trick and trap his way into victory. Logan typically comes off as air-headed and insufferable, and while the latter is true, Logan is actually quite intelligent and resiliant. He relies on his luck a bit too much, but he's perfectly capable of dipping into the arcane arts to show off his skills, or scrape past a difficult situation through perserverence.

### Description

Logan is a half-demon, one of the younger sons of By-Tor. His pale skin reverts to a dark grey when in contact with flame, and he displays quite a few demonic traits that mirror his father's, including a barbed tail, cloven hooves, slitted eyes, and sharpened teeth. He has two lop-sided green ram's horns curling out from his skull which he prizes greatly. Logan is a fan of collecting jewelry, and wears whatever he can collect wherever he can, including some promenint piercings on his horns and tail. The rest of his outfit is as flamboyent as he could make while still being conscientous of the fact that he needed to hide in the brush on a moment's notice.

Logan and his older brother Preston typically team up for battle, with Logan weilding a small crossbow and providing magical enchantments, and Preston weilding a large crossbow and sniping from afar. The two prefer to ambush and attach from afar, avoiding close combat at all costs. Unlike his brother, however, Logan can easily get drawn into taunting his enemies and become distracted in combat. Despite this strong flaw, Logan is surprisingly useful for distracting enemies, or scouting missions. His crossbow, Jourfewnrell, is made from Yjastav's body, and remains his weapon of choice, even though his magic is far stronger than a normal arrow.

### Story

Abandoned at birth, Logan was adopted by conartists Rabscuttle and Kleipsis, who had recently started up a new con in By-Tor's realm posing as a demon who demanded offerings from the local populace. When a demon child was left for him as sacrifice, the couple decided to raise them as their own. Logan enjoyed a cushy life in the hidden abode, learning showmanship from his stepdad and magic from his stepmom. As his parents grew old, he stepped into command as the head of the con, exaggurating his demonic features to try to rake in more power and gold from the locals.

As a teen running the con, though, he quickly ran into two of his older brothers: Kida and Logan. After assisting them with a favor, he was convinced into leaving his family to join with his brothers in trying to save some of the other half-children of By-Tor. The band travelled around for a few years before settling in the Far North under the protection of Lord Snowdog. In exchange for his protection, the brothers entered into the military service of Snowdog, but not before a year of growing acclimated to the new culture in which they now lived.

Logan used his year of freetime to finally learn Common tongue, and befriended Lady Parhelion in the process. With the wealth of knowledge at his doorstep, Logan also delved deep into the libraries of the Northern Keep and furthered his mastery of the arcane arts. When the time came around for him to enter the militia, Logan was offered the alternative of becoming a scholar of the Northern Keep instead, but turned it down to go fight with his brothers.

Logan and his brothers were inducted into a small platoon led by Lady Parhelion and spearheaded by two Silver Dragons, called the Silver Pact. Logan served as a mage on the platoon, focusing mainly on ground battle along with Kida, but mainly contributing in his ability to help the group survive in the far north's harsh conditions. After his first year of service, Logan was almost always removed from combat, instead helping on planning attacks and coordinating rather than using his arcana to smite down enemies. The platoon disbanded shortly after that due to the heavy death toll of the unit, including the temporary death of Preston, which prompted one of the dragons to leave the platoon as well.

After the disbanding of the Silver Pact, Logan assisted his elder brother with trying to start up the Nine of the North. The attempt to band together all the children of the Chaotic Lords was not well recieved, but eventually took hold, and Logan served as an enchanter and sorcerer on the team. 

### Drifters

After being captured by Spielascor, Logan was one of the last member's of the Nine freed, asking to stay behind so that his older brother could go free instead. During his time imprisoned, Logan spent his time studying Spielascor, and formulating a winning strategy for the next fight between them. Logan eventually went free as Preston destroyed Spielascor's first demi-plane, and was brought back to the safehouse to recover.

The Drifters first met Logan near the end of Fly By Night, right after the fall of the North as the Chaotic Lords abandoned their towns and were possessed. When the Drifters were brought to the Nine's safehouse, Logan interrogated them and pressured them in a way similar to Rabscuttle did earlier in the campaign, before revealing himself. In preperation for the final battle against Spielascor, Logan and Preston worked together to forge the Drifters non-metal variants of their equipment to use, and Logan worked with Kyurikom to invent a special "mech" for the Drifters to use as well.

During the final fight with Spielascor, Logan proved to fill two pivotal roles. First of all, Logan revealed himself to also have learned bardic magic while imprisoned, a skill that Lady Parhelion struggled with, but Logan excelled in. After Lady Parhelion sustained severe injuries and was unable to continue countering Spielascor's music on behalf of the Drifters, Logan was able to step in and continue the song to continue nullifying the magic. Secondly, Logan figured out a way to kill the immortal Spielascor, namely trapping it in one of Down's cards for his Deck of Familiars. Logan broke off both of his horns and gave them to Down to give him good luck on successfully capturing Spielascor.

After Spielascor's defeat, Logan was given his horns back, and joined Gloria's crew alongside his brothers and Lady Parhelion. It's not clear what role he serves on their ship.

### Relationships

- By-Tor: Logan's father. By-Tor would like him dead, but is more focussed on his older siblings to care about him much. Logan stole and reforged a version of Yjastav into his own personal crossbow: Jourfewnrell

- Rabscuttle: Logan's foster father. Adopted him and raised him as a successor to the couple's magical schemes. Logan looks up to him and carries on a lot of Rabscuttle's quirks.

- Kleipsis: Logan's foster mother. Taught Logan all he knows about magic, and protected him into adulthood. They're polar opposites, but very proud of one another.

- Kida: Logan's eldest brother. Dotes on Logan, but also keeps him in line. Responsible for a lot of Logan's practical education, and highly protective of him.

- Preston: Logan's older brother. Exhausted by Logan's personality, but the two get along well when it comes to projects and combat. Otherwise, they share a strained sibling bond of opposites living in close proximity for too long.

- Lady Parhelion: One of the closest friends Logan has, though Lady Parhelion is much closer with Kida. Logan pines for Lady Parhelion's attention, and is usually dissapointed to find the older she gets, the less she wants to hang out with him.

- Kyurikom: I hope for everyone's sake these two never associate with one another again

- Mytharious Orthello Casimer II: Respects Mytharious as a fellow mage, even if Mytharious doesn't respect him back. Is greatly insterested in learning more about Mytharious's abilities, and is quick grateful to the Orros as a whole in helping protect Preston in the past.
