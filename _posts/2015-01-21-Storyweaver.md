## Storyweaver
Campaign: Illumina

### Personality
Storyweaver had very few interactions so far, but from what can be inferred it seems that he is goal-oriented. He values his fellow crew members and the drifters on board, and plays an active role in assisting them in a fight. Despite his current initial quiet nature, Storyweaver is very invested in the motives and thoughts of everyone else and has plans to uncover those thoughts for his own personal interest.

### Description
The divination wizard appears to both have incredible and zero fashion sense. While the individual pieces of attire are well-crafted and stylish, the combination of all the items is taxing on the eyes. He uses his two wands as knitting needles.

### Story
Not much is yet known about Storyweaver beyond he was gaining passage to the mainland by assisting the drifter group. Storyweaver is not his real name; Whenever anyone asked his name, the wizard would tell the person he is just a story weaver.

### Drifters
Storyweaver met the current drifter group on their ship, The Driftwood. He was tasked to assist on the water, per the request of Ashell, in order to gain passage to the mainland. At the "get to know people" dice game he immediately sat out after rolling dice values that added up to the unlucky number 13, as he takes warning signs seriously.

When a storm appeared on the horizon, Storyweaver quietly cast an illusion to make the sky appear perfectly sunny so the group would continue onwards towards the mainland without any delay. This proved to be a poor decision because the weather wasn't the group's only obstacle. Pirates appeared on the horizon and started attacking The Driftwood after the drifters refused to hand any valuables over. Storyweaver spent most of his time analyzing the situation and current status of The Driftwood, and after hearing fighting ran up to the top deck, where Orro was running away from a fight and leaving one of their dragonborn crew to fend for themselves. Disgusted by his blatant lack of bravery and loyalty, Storyweaver pushed past Orro and cast spells to quash the enemies on deck and save his crew member.

Storyweaver again used his minor illusion in the city of Ebonwatch to make hoards of zombies appear as Rykke was being question for her use of zombies, which caused pandemonium and led to these drifters becoming wanted. What Storyweaver's intentions were for using this spell are unknown.

In the Mad Mage's Tower, Storyweaver again used minor illusion to make people in the distance scream bloody murder, further increasing tensions at the Family Crypt in Bogwash Swamp which eventually lead to, yet again, pandemonium. While Storyweaver's intentions are again unclear, there is no denying the pattern that's appearing. He also cast a spell hurting multiple innocent bystanders.

At the All Peak, Storyweaver spent most of the time on the Centipede steam train weaving a parachute cover of safety for his party members to leave and duck back into while the insect dug further into the hot ground. During this time Storyweaver talked to Orro, the party member who stayed back with him during the fights that ensued. He left his bags unsupervised.

### Relationships
- Tasma: Tasma and Storyweaver shared a tense interaction on The Driftwood before parting ways. They seem to know each other but the nature of their relationship is unknown.

- Megurin: Storyweaver doesn't appreciate how often her spells tend to have risk of hitting others including himself.

- Orro Elswynd: While cautious of him, Storyweaver doesn't necessarily see Orro as a threat. Using Mytharius as a mail system before the man started the official system, Storyweaver started taking interest in Orro as he had a clear connection of some kind.

- Rykke: Storyweaver takes little issue with necromancy and is surprised at the kindness, almost innocence, of the person using it. Storyweaver has taken an odd liking to one of Rykke's zombies, Chadwick, for some reason.
