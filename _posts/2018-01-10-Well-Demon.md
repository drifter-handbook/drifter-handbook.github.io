## Well Demon
Campaign: Illumina

### Description
Well-fed demon ogre that lurks underneath the cemetary of Northwatch. Its leathery skin is scraped and torn from prior battles, and its feet and arms are covered in rat bites. It resides in the sewers and has a small clutch of captured victims chained to the walls. The creature itself is large and bulbous, lacking in speed but compensating by using its arms to swing to higher locations. The Well Demon lacks armor, but several layers of fat and a tough dry skin protect it from minor attacks. Its vision and hearing are nothing extrordinary, but once the demon has found its quarry it becomes dangerous to deal with. The Well Demon is sturdy and imposing, able to withstand magical attacks and take damage without flinching. Its hide is easily pierced, but not easily cut. The twin cleavers it carries become deadly when weilded by a creature with strength that of a demon. The Well Demon appears to be corrupted by Cal'Cadoth's power, with several patches of skin discolored, porous, and sprouting tentacles. It exudes a viscuous black oil that appears to be related to the corruption.

### Drifters
First encountered while taking the sewer path up to Northwatch. The Well Demon was found at the bottom of the well leading up to the cemetary, and began to attack the drifters as they attempted to flee up the stairwell. Half the drifters fought off the demon to buy time for those trying to take Sunny to safety. The demon was not able to land more than one attack, however. Several spells and arrows weakened the monster in the first round, and Bernard Frump's sleep spell caused the demon to lose its grip on the stairwell and plummet to the bottom of the well, killing it instantly.

Reed, Kled, and Orro went to the bottom of the well afterwards to confirm the creature's death. At the base of the well, they found several humans near-death, chained to the wall and leaking the same black oil as the demon. It is unclear whether they were used to summon the demon, fed it power, or had another purpose entirely. The humans were killed and the place was searched, with samples of the black oil being taken. Kled and Orro each took one of the demon's cleavers, and Kled would use this weapon for the duration of the Illumina Campaign.
