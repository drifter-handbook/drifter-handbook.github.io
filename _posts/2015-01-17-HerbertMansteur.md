## Herbert Mansteur

Campaign: Feast of Legends

### Personality

Herbert Mansteur is a sweet, gentle man from the frozen south of the Deep Freeze. Always eager to help and make friends, those who meeting him in passing would likely describe him as avuncular and outgoing. However, this jovial demenor quickly falls away upon closer inspection.

### Description

Years of living in the Deep Freeze have honed Mansteurs body and practical skills, but have left him illiterate and somewhat ignotant of freshtovian etiquite. His tall, imposing figure is only further accentuated by the heavy tribal furs that halo his shaven head. His booming voice belies his reserved nature, though he often has difficulty controling its volume. 

### Story

This is where your known backstory goes

### Drifters

And this is anything that's happened in ur life since you became a drifter.


### Relationships

- Drifter Cannon: Mansteur sees the pain in Drifter's eye(s?) and empathizes deeply, he too having lost family and friend tryants. Due to the animistic faith of his homeland, the idea of a sentient cannon is rather mundate to Mansteur. While chaotic and reckless, Drifter means well, and their shared pain has caused Mansteur to see the cannon as a close friend, whether the feeling is reciprocated or not.

- Quart Tart: The old wizard's unwavering faith in Queen Wendy directly contradicting his chaotic disposition have left Mansteur weary of Quart. He wishes no ill upon the Spicy Man and will do anything he can to aid him, but intends to keep his distance when possible. Secrets are dangerous, especially in the presence of... eavesdroppers.

- Reed Idtentson: Reed is a cruel man with no honor or kindness in his heart. 

- Carol Baskins: Pretty Kitty. :)

- Queen Wendy: Having lived through the conquest and enslavement of the Deep freeze by the Ice Jester, Mansteur is wary of great rulers such as Wendy. Aboslute power corrupts absoultely, and if the words of Drifter Cannon are anything to go by, Wendy must be very powerful indeed. Still, he hopes that by earning the favor of one tyrant, he may be able to free his people from another.

- The Ice Jester: His tribe had words for beings like the Ice Jester, though none of them can be uttered witout bringing great and terrible curses upon oneself. He is evil incarnate, and Mansteur will go to any lenghts to free the Deep Freeze from the Jesters frozen clutches.
