## The Northern Keep
Campaign: Fly By Night

### Geography
The Northern Keep is by far the easist place to get oneself maimed or killed in the North, but also home to perhaps the strongest warriors and most knowledgable scholars in the nine realms. Deep within the heart of Niflheim, the Northern Keep is a large white conclave housing around 50-75 residents. The innermost building, known mainly as the keep itself, is a cathedral that has been converted into a massive library and university where most of the populace resides. Lord Snowdog rules over the Northern Keep, but due to his abudent absences, the true ruler of the keep is typically deferred to his wife, Lady Starlight.

There are plenty of reasons why the Northern Keep is widely regarded as a dangerous place, including but not limited to its bitterly cold climate, aggressive wildlife, aggressive residents, lack of water, unhealthy proximity to scholars with too much funding for their own good, haunted libraries, and the fact that the demon lord By-Tor invades once a month to destroy as much of the place as he can. Snowdog and Lady Starlight get a bit of aid in protecting their land from the Silver Dragons who also inhabit the realm, but the Northern Keep also sports the largest standing army which remains incredibly active in the defence of their land. While the Northern Keep is not safest in any sense of the word, those who survive within its walls are extrordinary additions to any fighting party.

### Places of Interest
- The Inner Keep: The cathedral at the heart of the keep holds most happenings in the city. Scholars are housed in dorm-like rooms along the length of the first floor, and soldiers are housed either within the walls of the keep or here in the inner keep's far side. The proportions of the Inner Keep are gigantic in the unrenovated areas, with doors and cielings reaching far above anyone's head. Even dragons can easily move around and navigate at near full size. In the back of the cathedral, a small throne sets dedicated to Lord Snowdog. It's seldom used. Instead, the room is typically repurposed for either holding war meetings or elaborate feasts and dances.

- The Scholars of the Northern Lights: A small organization of scholars living within the Inner Keep, and the university which they attend. The Scholars of the Northern Lights teach primarily clerical, druidic, and astronomical studies, though many scholars also pursue their own interests. The school boasts many experts in magic and war strategy alike, as well as exceptional resources for all in attendance. While tuition is free, few attend and fewer survive.

- Stables: A small but well-kept stables building near the heart of the Northern Keep. Lord Snowdog and the Scholars of the Northern Lights keep several types of creatures within the stables, all of which are highly capable of traversing the difficult terrain of the far north. The stables are one of the few warm areas of the city, and are one of the few wooden structures throughout the entire Northern Keep. The back enterance of the stables leads to a cave with direct access to the tundras outside the city, where the stables' larger inhabitants reside and guard.

- The Lower Library: There are many stages of libraries throughout the inner keep, but one of the most infamous is the lower library. The lower library is full of re-purposed and original areas from the keep's earlier days. Strong magics are setup in all of the rooms to confuse and deter looters. While the area is not off-limits, navigating the libraries is a pain, and finding the information one seeks down there is seldom an easy task.
