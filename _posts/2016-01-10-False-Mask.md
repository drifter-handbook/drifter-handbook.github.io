## False Mask
Campaign: Fly By Night

### Details

A powerful relic created by the Snowdog and gifted to Savvy. The mask appears to be made from porcelain and is lined with fur, but is surprisingly sturdy and easy to wear. When activated, an "X" appears above the user's head.

False Voice (Lv 1):
Whenever the user casts a music-based spell, roll a d20. On an 18 or above, the spell is cast twice at no cost to the user.

False Tongue (Lv 3):
User can now speak and understand Elven, Winter Wolf and Draconic. Reading/Writing is excluded from this.
