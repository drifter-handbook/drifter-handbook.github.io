## George Foreman, head of ~~Truth and Ideas~~ Propaganda

The division of Truth and Ideas is Queen Wendy's propaganda division, monitoring and reporting any dissent that occurs either in Freshtovia or its slave colonies. How it operates is kept as a closely guarded secret, but the mandatory installation of "air fresheners" in every building seems to indicate that George Foreman is keeping the Freshtovian people in line using a slow-acting psychoactive agent.

Since the air fresheners require several years to take effect, the propaganda division also takes a more direct approach: It prints large numbers of pro-Wendy posters, distributing these among every Freshtovian city during holidays and festivals. Below is an example of one of these posters:

Most disturbingly, Foreman's division is known to secretly arrest anyone with dissenting ideas and gather them in "re-education" camps. The few that return are completely loyal to Queen Wendy and her nation, with no trace of their original personality left. When I talked to the children of a man that was taken by Foreman's division, they forcefully denied that he had ever existed.

Due to fact that very few Freshtovian citizens' know that the Machine nations exist, it appears that the propaganda division is also keeping the Freshtovian people unaware of Freshtovia's actions abroad.
