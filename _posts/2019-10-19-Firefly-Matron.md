## Quart Tart
Campaign: Illumina

### Description
An unnamed blind woman of an unknown age, or at least that's how she initially appears.

### Drifters
After venturing deep below the roads of Dalot, the drifters find themselves in a world that is unfamiliar to them, but is very familiar to the drifters of the past. This underground world is a twisted and reformed version of the one from the reborn and ashen campaigns. After Orro sends out magic to carefully observe the town from a distance, the drifters decide to enter a rundown but candle-lit tavern where the unnamed woman awaits. She offers food and riddles meant to guide the party, but provides no insight beyond that.

Following one of the last riddles provided to them, the party goes to a bell tower where the Firefly Matron awaits in a rocking chair. This time she appears to be limp, with the occasional firefly coming out of her mouth. When the tower collapses, however, the old woman proves that she is still very much alive and does little to explain the multitude of fireflies now pouring out of her lips. After guiding the party to their next destination she disintegrates into fireflies.

### Relationships
Unknown.
