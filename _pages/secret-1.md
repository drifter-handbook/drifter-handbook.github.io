THE CHAOTICS

The Chaotics formed a brotherhood of their own freewill. However, they would spend the next hundred years at each other's throats. Never was such a volatile group banded, and never will they part.

There are four who hold this title:

The Snowdog, ruler of Niflheim
Bytor, ruler of Muspelheim
The Monk Aster, who oversees Vanaheim
And Guildmaster, who has no say in any matter in Nidavellir

These four once stood together to conquer the north, each for their own purposes. They've ended the wars between the giants and dragons, and now set themselves upon enclaves in their domain. Each wields a disgraced blade, imbued with a soul stone that can give men fates worse than death.

They are not gods, they merely deal among them.

They have no weakness, and we have never seen death touch one.

The Chaotics rule the North, and so it shall continue to be until it is not.

THE SNOWDOG

The last of the Chaotics to be called to arms. He fights for the protection of life, and the pursuit of knowledge, but most importantly to keep Bytor at bay. Raised as a lowly huntsman, The Snowdog often harasses his enemies by ambushing them in the forests in guise, and seldom returns to his throne. He rules Niflheim but only oversees the Scholars of the Northern Lights. The rest of the enclave is run by his love, Lady Starlight. While uncouth, he is often portrayed as a genius.

The Snowdog wields two blades, both bastard swords. The first is the blue disgraced blade. It stands at four feet, and its stone stores thirty souls. The second blade is Freyrstav, the King of all Swords. He is a sentient frostblade, found by Snowdog and assisting him throughout his ventures. As of the past two years, he has been gone. Beyond this, the Snowdog also wears a magical cloak which allows him to shapeshift. He wove the cloak together over three years, sewing together animal pelts and imbuing his strongest magics into their furs. They say he spends more time in beastskin then as an aged man.

The Snowdog is a good and understanding man, and the most forgiving of the Chaotics. However, he is also the most regretful, and the one with the most to lose. He is appears the most mortal of the Chaotics, but is considered the most dangerous because of it. The Snowdog's greatest strengths lies with his aid from allies and his people, and his ability to think quickly and rationally to win every battle. He is undefeated in every regard, even against the demon Bytor. The few failures he has seen have yet to come to fruition.

He has one daughter, Lady Parhelion, who fights with the Nine.

BYTOR

The demon king, Bytor, claimed his plane only through the acts of the Chaotics combined. He thirsts for blood more than anything else, but is kept in line by The Snowdog, albiet poorly. Once a paladin, Bytor renounced his ways and sold his body for that of an unspeakable form. It is in this form that he now resides, and he spends his days among his minions in Muspeilheim, biding his time to rise again. While vicious, he is often portrayed as tame.

Bytor wields the green disgraced blade. It stands at five feet, and its stone stores millions of souls. When the blade once stood empty, it is said that Bytor once trapped a demigod in its hilt, rather than fight the man one-on-one. His weapon of choice, though, is Mothrinlaw, the Queen of all Swords. Mothrinlaw is responsible for the destruction of one of the branches of Yggdrasil, though not the one that you would think.

Bytor cannot be harmed by fire, steel, and cannot drown. He must be fought with wit or hand. There is no sense to his destruction, nor will anything sate his appetite. He continues to build his domain.

He has countless children, but kills them all. Only three have managed to elude his touch: Kida the Strong, Preston the Ace, and Logan the Luck-Touched. They fight with the Nine.

THE MONK ASTER

His name is unknown, but he is simply known as Aster. The monks were among the first mortals to settle in the divine realms of the North, and Aster among them as an orphaned child. He sought to settle the squabblings of men, and turned his gaze to the mountains. Through the acts of the Chaotics, he came to end the war between the Dragons and the Giants, and spoke the final judgement upon them both. Now he resides in the monastery on Vanaheim, where all come to seek his guidance and serve beneath him. While indifferent, he is often portrayed as conniving.

The Monk Aster requires no blades, but he holds the red disgraced blade. It stands at four feet tall, and its stone stores no souls. The Monk Aster is famous his technique in open-hand fighting. So long as he is able to lay a hand upon you, he can end your life at any point within the next week, no matter the distance between you two. Any wound inflicted upon him appears not only on his assailant's flesh, but on their kin and offspring for generations to come.

While none of the Chaotics can be found asleep, the Monk Aster is the only of the four who also forgoes food and drink. It is said that his sight pierces not only the body, but the mind. He shows no interest in anything besides the task of judgement and the oversight of a small garden in the middle of the monastery.

He has three daughters, whose minds are fused together through the Dwarven gift of Sifstrand. They are the Daughters of Flowers, known individually as Maragan, Tai, and Shan, and they fight with the Nine.

GUILDMASTER

Little is known about Guildmaster and his relation to the Chaotics, beyond his acts among them. The first story of him recounts of his attack on Aster's monastery when they both were young. His motives are unknown, beyond his greed. His face is seldom seen, and conflicting accounts are given. He is identified, instead, by his weapons and his hands: one dipped in silver, and the other in gold. There is no pattern on either hand, nor any imperfection in the coating, and they move silently. Guildmaster supposedly resides in Nidavellir and controls the town, though none will admit it. While mysterious, Guildmaster is portrayed as proud.

Guildmaster wields the yellow disgraced blade. It stands at five feet tall, and holds one soul. Through no discernable means, he is also able to control a storm of needles. Most confrontations with Guildmaster begin with a needle against the questioner's eye. In wartime, he was known for walking into battles casually with five hundred needles flurried around him, reducing anyone in the way to a bloodied pulp. 

Though considered the weakest of the Chaotics, Guildmaster is also the most irrational. Whereas The Snowdog is guided by what is right, Bytor by his bloodlust, and Aster by his judgementâ€¦ Guildmaster's wants and needs change constantly. As such, he has a high level of attendants who serve him in secrecy. These people can be anyone, since Guildmaster's whims can change and align with even the most devout man's quest. Some say his secrecy is a front, but others believe he hides secrets from the other Chaotics and  makes himself lowlier than he truly is.

He has two children. Nothing is known about them besides their masks of silver and gold. They fight with the Nine.
