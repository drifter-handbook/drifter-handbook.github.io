## Papa John
Campaign: Fly By Night 

### Description

A transmuted bone fiend, sprung to life from the realm of Muspeilheim and druidic magics. Papa John is a large, skeletal creature with scythe-like legs and a poisonous bladed tail. It resembles a cross between a deer and a skeleton, but unlike most variants of bone <a href="https://drifter-handbook.github.io/fearmonger" >fiends</a>, it lacks flesh of any kind between its rotten bones. When inanimate, it resembles nothing more than a pile of old bones and metal.

Papa John in particular is a bone fiend bound to the forsaken Yrudus staff. 

### Drifters

Back before the Drifters first met the Chaotic Lords truly for the first time, the Drifters were given the opportunity to prove themselves in the Moosejaw Arena. Playing for the amusement of Hera and By-Tor, the Drifters were divied up into teams based on their alligiance. The prize for the winner of these tournaments would be to kill a Blue Eyed White Dragon, as Down had requested to the Chaotics previously. Not truly understanding what was meant by that prize, the Drifters nevertheless proceded to the tournament.

Battling their way through, it became apparent that the judges of the competition were favoring those of the green alignment, but that did not stop other teams from progressing. Mild irritation bred into full on aggression as the Drifters began to truly team up and fight for their Chaotic Lords for the first time. Through wit and valor, champions emerged... and were ignored when By-Tor declared his two champions to be the contestants for the final round anyways, ignoring the true winners of the match.

As the losers were escorted away to rot in prison, they found themselves face-to-face with the jaw skeleton who stood as their prison guard. The skeleton seemed startled to find the Drifters returning, and the two parties quickly became embroiled in a stange standoff as they tried to interpret each other's intentions. During the altercation, Nero grabbed hold of the skeleton's staff, which quickly morphed into the being known as Papa John.

Fleeing out into the battlefield, the Drifters were pursued by three splinters of Papa John, two of which were quickly dispatched by By-Tor. The remaining Papa John, however, lashed out and struck down several of the Drifters, and they became panicked at their inability to fight such a fearsome foe. Using the terrain of the battlefield to their advantage, though, the Drifters managed to lure Papa John close enough to the game board to get him attached to one of the trap cards. Seeing his chesspiece spawn as a viable unit atop the game's chessboard, they began cutting and destroying the chesspiece, destroying Papa John in the process.
