## Quart Tart's Letter

A letter handed to me by an old man named Quart Tart. It reads as follows:

<i>
Drifter Cannon,

I apologize for contacting you like this instead of speaking in person, but due to personal circumstance I cannot speak freely. And I also apologize for using a fake name, I know “Quart Tart” isn’t exactly convincing but creativity isn’t one of my strong suits and I’m taking precautions to protect myself. I would like to keep my identity secret, but if you feel knowing my name is necessary then let me know.

I will be frank: one of the drifters is a danger to the rest of my personally associated drifters and, depending on his knowledge and how the power changes him, potentially other drifters. Due to keeping my distance to preserve my own safety I don't know his true name, but what I do know is that he is a study of the arcane arts and uses that knowledge to predict the future and gain knowledge of other realms. I know as much as I do about the other worlds and us drifters as a side effect of his actions. He listens in on conversations he should have no access to, creeps his senses into rooms he should not be aware of. He has gone by many names: Travis Broadtree, Ellis, Storyweaver, The Past Teller, all of them are fake. I call him the listener.

If I thought this were merely harmless information collection then I would keep my problems to myself, but something happened to him. Something snapped. I believe it is now beyond a form of obsession, though to what exact nature I'm not sure. The more information he connects the more frantic he becomes and the more... unstable my associated drifters become.

And now the reason why I contacted you in the first place: based off your name I believe you know at least one other group of drifters and know exactly what I speak of when I say drifters from different worlds. I held off contacting you at first, but based off of your mannerisms I believe my hunch is correct. If I am wrong, please disregard this message and pretend I never said anything. Burn or eat this note. Do you have any way to contact other drifters, even one? While information by chained messages is not the most reliable, if I could pass a warning to eventually reach the drifters spending time with the listener then they will know to be weary and protect themselves.

I need to stay in here for as long as I can; the listener struggles to hear in this place a bit more than other places. I will let you know if I can find out more. Let me know as well. Your words are safe; if I don't speak then he can't hear. I hope that you will assist in this matter.

"Quart Tart"

### Drifter Cannon's Comments

The old man who gave this to me, Quart Tart, appears to be a Queen Wendy loyalist. Though this may be a trap, I will not turn down an opportunity to make a new ally. It appears Quart Tart is connected to (and may be a member of) the group called the "Drifters," and he would like me to pass on a warning to the rest of them.

This presents a fantastic opportunity. If I can make allies of the Drifters, it will be significantly easier to achieve my goals. Since the entity who gave me the [Mysterious Note](/cannonsjournal/doc1.html) seems to be reading this journal and is connected to the Drifters, maybe it can help with this matter, whatever it is.
