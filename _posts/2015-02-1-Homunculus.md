## Orro's Homunculus

Campaign: Driftwood

### Personality
Bean usually flips between being very excitable, and napping peacefully around Orro's neck. When active, he flies around Orro's head, often rushing towards people who have shown him affection in the past seeking pats. Bean greatly enjoys orange slices and cashews, and dislikes milk, much to Orro’s dismay as an avid milk drinker.

### Description
Bean is about the size of a squirrel, is very fluffy, and spends most of their time sleeping curled around Orro’s neck. He has a tendency to sneeze when excited, and when in combat, these sneezes can launch balls of concentrated arcane energy. Outside of combat, these sneezes can result in singed hair and clothing, but are generally harmless.

### Story

Bean is a small homunculus created by Orro to assist in various tasks related to the drifters. Bean also serves as Orro’s stress relief animal, as travelling with the group is very VERY stressful.

### Relationships

 - Bean sees Orro as a great source of pats.
 - Bean sees Lady Parhelion as a great source of food.
