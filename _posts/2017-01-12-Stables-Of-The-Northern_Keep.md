## Stables of the Northern Keep
Campaign: Fly By Night

### Geography
A small but well-kept stables building near the heart of the Northern Keep. Lord Snowdog and the Scholars of the Northern Lights keep several types of creatures within the stables, all of which are highly capable of traversing the difficult terrain of the far north. The stables are one of the few warm areas of the city, and are one of the few wooden structures throughout the entire Northern Keep. The back enterance of the stables leads to a cave with direct access to the tundras outside the city, where the stables' larger inhabitants reside and guard.

Besides the named mounts below, the stables are home to several Clydsdale horses and Winter Wolves. The horses are more plentiful than the wolves, but are seldom used due to their difficulty to keep alive in the harsh weather. Horses are typically used while travelling to warmer regions, and are excercised often due to their disuse. The Winter Wolves are used more commonly by Lord Snowdog's soldiers, but are considered to be themselves soldiers as well. They <a href="https://drifter-handbook.github.io/stablemaiden" >serve Lord Snowdog </a>in exchange for lodging, food, and occasionally wealth, but are mercenaries who can come and go by their own right.

### Occupants of Interest
- Bayden: Also known as the Magekiller, Bayden is the leader of the Winter wolves, and is the largest by a noticible degree. He is supposedly a decendent of Fenrir, though Lord Snowdog claims otherwise. Unlike most of the other Winter Wolves, Bayden can understand most languages, including Common. While he is clearly a capable fighter, Bayden has a fierce temper that has only just begun to mellow out with age. In his youth, any magic-user who rode him into battle wound up dead, earning him his nickname. In recent years though, Bayden has become a highly reliable mount, and seems to care deeply about undoing his questionable reputation with mages in the past. Kida and Mytharious Orthello Casimer II are notable riders of Bayden.

- Lilium: Lady Starlight's mount, a young and lithe black unicorn. While not intelligent enough to speak or spellcast, Lilium only allows Lady Starlight as her rider and shows immense distaste at all other visitors. Her body is a natural amplifier of magic, boosting the spells of anyone astride her in battle. Her pelt also has a minor antimagic ability, and being pierced with her horn causes temporary blindness.

- Mextan: The eldest of the Winter wolves, a creature infested with fleas and mange do to his age. He is one of the few original Winter Wolves to have lived into the current era, and is ostracized by the other Winter Wolves as a result. It is likely that he works under Lord Snowdog because he would not survive on his own out in the tundra. While his fighting prowess is phenomenal along with the rest of his kin, he lacks the survival skills the others possess, and often ends campaigns highly dehydrated. Jester Klatz is a notable rider of Mextan.

- Lunate: An edgy wolf with a black pelt and red eyes. One of the newer arrivals to the stables, but now a constant presence. Lunate is a mixed breed Winter wolf, though his other half of genes is unknown. Despite being cold and distant from the rest of the pack, he is surprisingly easy to work with, and is now used to train beginners in wolf-riding. Due to his lineage, Lunate lacks the spellcasting abilities of the other wolves, but possesses sharper senses and a natural understanding of Infernal.
