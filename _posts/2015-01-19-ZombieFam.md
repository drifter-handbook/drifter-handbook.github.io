## Ryyke's Undead Entourage

Campaign: Illumina

### Personality

A group of reanimated corpses, the Benedicted Troupe lacks most higher brain function. With the exception of the changeling zombie Chadwick, they act solely on instincts or the telepathic commands of their master. When not following an order, they are known to wander and curiously inspect their surroundings, almost like a child playing with a new toy. 

### Description

The Benedicted troup is composed of the reanimated corpses of Gravewaker Konikryyke’s fallen followers and companions, as well as bodies scavenged during her pilgrimage. While Gravewaker tradition often dictates extensive rites and procedures to prevent the bodies’ desiccation, many of the more recently revived were not afforded this luxury as they were awakened in the heat of battle. Thus there are two distinct groups within the troupe, the disciples and the conscripted.

The disciples appear more as mummies than zombies, their skin thickly wrapped in medicated cloth and exquisitely dressed, likely to make them more palatable to the world at large. Made from those devoted to Ryyke’s cause who willingly gave their bodies on their deathbed, they are well muscled, stand fairly upright, and each don a custom-made wooden funerary mask. The preparations made before their reanimation prevents them from decomposing, and they retain much of their motor control. Chadwick is the last remaining member of this category. 

The conscripted are the zombies Ryyke has raised from fallen adversaries. Often raised in haste, they have a lumbering gait and plaid green skin, wearing what they did in their final moments. As they were not properly prepared, they frequently show signs of deterioration, move in swift, jerky movements, and give off an unpleasant odor. Currently Ryyke controls four conscripted undead, all fallen nobles and mercenaries from Bogwash Swamp. 
Chadwick is unique among the Benedicted troupe, and even among his fellow disciples. In life he was a changeling like his master. Due to their malleable skin, Changelings do not decompose and as such, Chadwick lacks the mummy-like wrappings of the others of his ilk. His funerary mask is that of a four-eyed Ur-Giant, massive eldritch beings that ruled the world before the gods according to the Dirt Spire mythology. Having been with Ryyke the longest, his suite is faded and patched in places, though there is noticeable care put into its maintenance. While lacking higher brain function as a result of his artificial soul, Chadwick does seem cognizant enough to perform more complex orders such as cooking food or operating simple machinery. He stays near his master whenever possible, indicating there may be some remaining hint of affection towards her.

### Relationships

- Ryyke: The Gravewaker that gave them life, the troupe is sworn to Ryyke’s service in thanks. In life, they were all friends or acquaintances and each has a special connection to their master. The Benedicted known as Chadwick was once her lover, and the two are exceptionally close even in spite of their new dynamic.

- The Drifters: While the Benedicted are by no means intelligent, the Drifter’s aversion to their nature is not lost on them, nor their master.

- Storyweaver: Chadwick has taken an interest in the colorful mage, though the nature of their interactions remains a mystery. During low-intensity situations, the two can be occasionally seen hunched over one of Storyweaver's many writings, almost as if they are studying.
