## Chapter Four

## Another Attempt

### A Week Later

### Nero's House

Lucille leaves his house around midafternoon and walks the streets with his head bowed low. He walks up to a yellow and black house not knowing that its Nero's and knocks on the front door. Skozz walks to the door and opens it with a grilled cheese sandwich by his mouth and he looks up at Lucille slightly.

"Oh hey... Are you big brother Nero's friend?" Skozz asked. Lucille nods slightly.

"Though I really need to use the restroom..." Lucille said.

"Um sure, just down the hall." Skozz points to the door with the hand holding the sandwich as he opens the door completely letting Lucille in. The immortal goes into the house and walks down the hall to the bathroom.

"Thanks," the beige-suited man said. Skozz closes the front door.

"No problem," Skozz said before yelling in a loud tone. "BRO I NEED ANOTHER!" Lucille goes into the bathroom closing the door behind him.

"All right! Shut up! I'm working on it!" Nero said irritated. Nero continues making the grilled cheese sandwiches. Lucille flushes the toilet, washes his hands when he is finished, and then he opens the door walking out of the bathroom.

"Is Nero here?" Lucille asked. Skozz is sitting on the couch and plays "Monster Hunter" on the Playstation.

"Yeah, he is in the kitchen..." Skozz answered. Lucille quietly walks to the kitchen door, leans on the doorframe, and watches Nero make grilled cheese sandwiches. Bojo is sitting at the kitchen table reading a magazine. Skozz starts to get angry at the game. "NO! I DIED ON THE FIRST ROUND AGAIN!" Lucille flinches from the loudness of Skozz's voice.

"SKOZZ!" Nero yelled. Skozz flinches at Nero's yell. Nero turns around after finishing the grilled cheese, and he looks right at Lucille. "Damn it, pervert. How'd you get in here?"

"Sorry bro..." Skozz said.

"Your brother let me in to use the restroom," Lucille answered Nero.

"SKOZZ!" Nero yelled again.

"Sorry!" his brother said.

"I guess I will be going now..." Lucille said in a low voice. He places a small black box on the counter before leaving the kitchen.

"Nero-chan..." Bojo said.

"I guess you can stay. Just don't be a pervert," Nero said with a huff. Lucille looks at Nero.

"I don't want to impose where I am not wanted." Lucille said.

"It's fine. You can stay," Nero said rudely. Nero looks away, then he walks around him and over to Skozz and gives him the other grilled cheese sandwich. Skozz takes the sandwich and eats it while still playing the game. Lucille stands there somewhat dumbstruck. "Look. You either accept the offer or get out and don't bother talking to me again." He walks over to the counter as Lucille goes and sits on the couch next to Skozz.

"Thanks," Lucille said. Nero looks at the box on the counter. Lucille watches Skozz play Monster Hunter. The young dwarf starts getting aggravated with the game again. The box has a small red bow on top. The immortal just continues to watch Skozz play the game. Nero looks at the bow and unties it with a sigh. The immortal watches Skozz play his game, not noticing Nero is opening the box that he left on the counter.

Nero opens the box. He sees a bronze tree with his name engraved on it. He groans deeply and throws it in the garbage can. There is a disgusted look on his face. Lucille closes his eyes as he hears the metal tree clang in the can.

I am not good enough for him... Lucille thought to himself.

"Is something wrong, man?" Skozz asked. Lucille shakes his head and stands up.

"I seem to have overstayed my welcome. I will be going now..." Lucille said and goes to the front door and looks at Nero with a tear in his eye. "Later Nero-chan."

"Nero..." Bojo said. Lucille opens the front door and leaves the house closing it behind him. Bojo follows Lucille outside. "Um... W-what's your name?" Lucille looks at Bojo, tears staining his usually warm face.

"My name?" he asked.

"Yes. Please tell me your name... I'm Bojo."

"My name is... Lucille Johnson... I am no one special." Lucille said rather reluctantly.

"Are you saying that because of Nero-chan?" Bojo asked with a frown. Lucille nods his head slowly. "Every one of us is special. You are an immortal. You see, Nero is only like this because he and I are player-made characters. He is the way he is because... he has gotten hurt a lot. Since he rolled poorly, he was injured many times."

"But I-I..."

"Please forgive him. He is mean to people because he doesn't trust them. So to keep him from getting hurt again, he is mean to keep others away... it's like his shield of protection. He was mean to me at first, too."

"But I-I... l-love... him..."

"I noticed." Bojo said with a smile. Lucille looks away sadly.

"I should not even love him. I am no good for him. He said so himself."

"Maybe that's what he needs to break through his shield. If you keep trying, I'm sure he'll give in eventually."

"I doubt it."

"Well, if you think like that, then maybe you aren't good enough for him. If you truly love Nero-chan, you wouldn't give up on him. That's part of being trustworthy."

"I will never give up on him."

"Okay then," Bojo said smiling again.

"I will see you another time. Here, can you give this to Nero-chan?" Lucille hands Bojo a slip of paper with his cell number on it. Bojo takes the paper and looks at it.

"Oh, okay." Then Bojo goes back inside the house.
