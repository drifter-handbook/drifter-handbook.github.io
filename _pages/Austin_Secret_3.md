Some hunters do not overwhelm their prey in an instant with a blinding show of force.

Some strike out of nowhere and hope the element of surpise is enough.

But a rare few have no need for strenght or stealth.

Fear is a slow killer, but more deadly than any tooth, nail or knife.

A true hunter allows the prey to do their work for them, fr no death is more certain than that which one makes for themself.

The Presistence Hunter draws near.

Don't blink.
