## Chapter One

## An Unintended Meeting

### Neo-Tokyo, Japan

Lucille is walking on the sidewalk in the early morning hours with his head held low and his cell phone in his right hand. Nero is walking down the same sidewalk holding his shield angrily. Lucille bumps into Nero without noticing and Nero falls to the ground.

"Watch where you're going, idiot!" Nero said rudely. Nero looks up at him with a glare in his eyes. Lucille doesn't flinch and continues to stare in awe. "Quit staring, you pervert!" Nero stands up and realizes his shield was dented from the fall. "Oh n-no... Oh God, no!" Nero turns to face Lucille. "Look what you did!" He shows him his dented shield.

"I can replace that if you want..." Lucille said in a low voice.

"You better since you caused this!"

"Technically, I am not to blame; you were the one who was holding the shield in front of your face."

"You were the one who wasn't paying attention while walking!"

"You don't seem to like me much, do you?" Lucille asked with a sigh.

"No, I don't!" Nero snarled. Lucille flinches this time.

"What kind of shield do you want?" Nero lifts his damaged shield up and shows him.

"One like this! Duh!"

"Come with me then," he said. Nero rolls his eyes.

"Fine," Nero said, stomping after Lucille. Lucille walks to the phone store, not realizing that he had dropped his phone on the ground and Nero had stepped on it, breaking it. He rubs his face in irritation. "Idiot, you shouldn't have been holding your shield at all!" He picks up the shield. "Watch where you're going next time, moron." Lucille checks his pockets for his phone.

"Damn, I didn't even know that I dropped it."

"Idiot! Don't have it in your hand unless you're using it and that won't happen!" Nero hands the phone to him rather rudely. "Here!" The phone has been squished beyond use and he takes it in his right hand.

"Sorry..." Lucille said meekly.

"Humph. Now you need a new phone too which means less money to buy me a new shield."

"Yeah, it would seem so..." They continue walking.
