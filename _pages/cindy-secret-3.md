A lost note on aged paper, with a yellow wax seal. It says the following:

>What separates us from one another? If the tales of old are to be believed, we were once all molded by the same clay. The body is of no consequence; when broken down, there is less than 1% of components that differ between the intellectual species, different races or not. In the end, we all fade away and decompose identically.

>If our bodies are similar, who's to say any different of the soul? If two separate entities were to grow up with identical experiences, develop identical opinions, and live identical yet separate lives, could we truly claim them to be separate entities at all? Would the two continue to be the same when introduced to one another? It's never been done since there are always unique variables in a person's life, but what is the soul when the unique variables are removed? Like the clay, are our souls indistinguishable? Are some, or all, of them parts of a greater whole?

>Can we decide what kind of soul that would be?
