## Skozz's Fire Sword
Campaign: Reborn

### Details

Found and weilded by Skozz Stonebrow while he was a reborn creature. The sword is shorter in length than most longswords, making it well-fit for someone of dwarven stature. The sword is wholly unremarkable, being partially damaged and scuffed, and bound in cheap black leather.


### Effect

A normal longsword. On a nat20, the sword bursts into flames. This effect was never triggered while being weilded by the Drifters.

### Feats

Felled a tree onto an innocent tavern
Lost in the second visit to the Trial of Heroes, when Skozz attempted to cut off the Lantern Carrier's leg to free her from the Velvet zombies at the bottom of the trial's pool.
The Lantern Carrier later sacrificed her leg in Uln in an attempt to barter with the gods to return the sword.
