## Chapter Two

## A New Shield

Lucille and Nero are standing in the middle of the sidewalk talking. "If you are going to buy me a replacement shield for the one that you damaged, we should continue walking then instead of just standing here like idiots," Nero said. Lucille nods slightly before walking forward with his head down, hiding a blush. Neru continues walking this time, watching where he is going.

### The Phone and Shield Store

Gakupo opens the door to the store and stands aside to let Nero go ahead of him. "After you..." Lucille said.

"Humph..." Nero goes into the store with his arms crossed over his chest. Lucille follows Nero inside slowly and looks at the phones on display. Nero sees all of the phones and gets thoroughly excited. Lucille watches him from afar. Nero picks up a red shield. Lucille picks up a beige phone.

"Eh..." Nero decided to get the one that he picked up.

"I want to get this one." Lucille on the other hand is having trouble finding a good phone. "What the hell is taking you so long?"

"I cannot find a good phone that I like." Nero crosses his arms.

"Well, hurry up. It doesn't take that long to pick out a phone. Why not buy that beige one over there?" He points to the phone not far from Lucille's left hand in an attempt to be nice. He looks at the phone and picks it up.

"Yes, this will do nicely. Thanks." Nero looks away blushing very faintly, but has an angry look on his face.

"Stupid." Lucille takes the phone from Nero and heads to the counter to pay for them.

"I would like to get these this phone and that shield."

"Let me get those for you then," the Clerk said. Lucille hands the phones over to the clerk. The man rings up both phones and gets the amount due. "That would be 1100GP."

"All right." Lucille pays the man the money and gets the phone and shield back. He goes to hand Nero the shield. Nero crosses his arms as he walks over to the counter. "Here you go as promised."

"Humph." Nero takes the shield from him.

"You're welcome, Emperor," Lucille said with a slight smile. Nero takes the time to try out the new shield, stops abruptly, and glares at the older man.

"E-emperor?! You pervert!" Nero stutters. Lucille blushes a deep scarlet red.

"I just mean that you're beautiful..." Lucille said slowly. A shocked look crosses Nero's face as he looks away with an angry glare; a blush creeps over his face and he turns and walks out of the store. Lucille follows more slowly. "Wait!" Nero stops walking and whirls around to face Lucille with a glare on his face.

"What, idiot?"

"I-I didn't get your name..."

"Why should I give you my name, pervert?"

"Never mind. You don't have to tell me your name. My name is Lucille Johnson though." He bows slightly showing the briefcase on his left hip. Nero turns away and starts walking, then stops and with a sigh he faces him again.

"My name is Nero. I-it's not like I wanted to tell you my name or anything. I just didn't want you to keep bothering me about it." He blushes again.

"Nero, such a beautiful name for a roman..."

"Pervert," Nero said. Lucille sighs heavily. Nero starts walking again and as he heads home, he tests out his new shield, trying out a few poses.

Lucille starts walking home; his head held high as images of the dark-haired man plays in his mind.
