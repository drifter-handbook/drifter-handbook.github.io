# Hadal Keep

## Description
Little is known of Hadal Keep, other than it is a prison, and that those who are doomed to its halls are never seen again. Many things, however, are rumored about the prison.

## Clockwork Guards

The most common rumor associated with the prison are the guards. The only thing alive in the prison are the prisoners but the guards are hulking masses of machinery. It is impossible to convince or barter with them as they have no mind beyond their sacred duty and no morals beyond enforcing order.

## Deep Caverns

Hadal keep is known to be vast. How else would it hold so many dangerous criminals? Some say the prisoners never escape because they're put in the center of the keep and spend their whole lives wandering to find an exit.

## The Prisoners

Regardless of how well the prisoners are kept contained, some of them are said to have formed pockets of civilization, much like the cities and towns they lived in on the outside. The Clockwork Guards despise this form of chaos so these small enclaves are often under attack, forced to defend themselves or be eradicated by the guards.
