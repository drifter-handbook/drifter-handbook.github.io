## Tasma Greyhood

Campaign: Illumina

### Personality
Tasma has a deep devotion to Evra, the goddess of pleasure. Her personal goals are focused on further spreading the religion of Evra and converting more people to become Children of the Trident. She becomes irate whenever anyone questions her religion or goddess, but tries her best to keep a cool head for the most part. Her success in that is up for debate. Her morals are questionable as she doesn't seem to be all to concerned about the concept of death or seeing others be murdered, but she doesn't participate and takes a hands-off approach except when she feels her skills are necessary in a fight.

### Description
Tasma is a female hill dwarf with deep tan skin, light brown hair, and brown eyes. She is 4'5'' in stature wearing minimal light clothing so her quick monk movements aren't restricted. Her clothing is full of various red hues, likely in respect to her red naga goddess.

### Story
A holy monk, Tasma boarded one of the Empire ships setting sail to Gotland to assist in helping other people follow the will of her goddess Evra. These plans were put to a temporary halt, however, when the ship was attacked by Cal'Cadoth. As a means to an end, Tasma joined the small group of remainign survivors until she reached the nearest city. Luckily there were other Children of the Trident in the party that ranked below her, so she knew she could rely on their assistance. Once again her plans were changed when she noticed the fish scale in her hand as well as the ominous countdown in her dreams.

As a Child of the Trident, Tasma's top priority in the campaign was to start spreading the religion of Evra in this new world and would use any means necessary to do so. So when her fellow religious companions discovered that bloodore was in the new land, they all made it a priority to find and refine as much of the ore as possible to use for recruitment purposes as was done back in the Empire. While the non-religious companions had their suspicions, Tasma believes that they were able to slip enough under the radar to continue their plans undisturbed.

When in the Old World, Rammestein and Heimrich attempted to pray to the goddess and couldn't find her presence. In her own personal time, Tasma went to pray to confirm these suspicions. The outcome of this isn't common knowledge. Tasma started to lose more of her sanity in the Old World when confronted with a goblin chopping off horse heads and a decaying head that would talk to only her.

After coming back up from the Old World and successfully fighting off Cal'Cadoth's army for the time being, Tasma decided to stay in Dalot in the house given to them along with her fellow religious members and a grumpy Reed. At this time she is focusing on cultivating the religion of Evra in the broken city.

### Relationships
-Rammestein & Heimrich: Tasma finds their enthusiasm in spreading the religion Evra, even if their belief in "essencial oils" is misinformed.

-Andal: A fellow Child of the Trident that she trusts to do her most important tasks.

-Bernard Frump: Tasma doesn't know what to make of the man, but he doesn't get in her way.

-Reed: Antagonistic towards Tasma during the campaign, but more friendly as of late. Tasma dislikes how he treats her religious readings and doesn't trust her with the secrets of Evra, but doesn't necessarily see him as an enemy.

-Athil: She was able to pay him off to keep him from telling the party more about the religion. She has no issues with men who can be paid off.

-Raz: While not a Child of the Trident, Raz agreed to keep the drug deal secret. Tasma appreciates Raz's discretion.

-Storyweaver: Tasma doesn't want to talk about this.
