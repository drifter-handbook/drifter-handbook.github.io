## Miss Dyo Arteri
Campaign: Nuova (Drachend), Fly By Night

### Personality
Miss Dyo Arteri, commonly called Dyo, is exactly what you think of her when first meeting the gnome. Her neutral emotional state is irritated, and her personality is a wide array from mild disgruntlement to pure rage. It's unknown if "happy" or "carefree" are emotions that she understands. She seems to be less angry when bathing in the blood of her enemies during battle. Regardless, she seems to understand the basic benefits of teamwork and will work with others when she feels it's beneficial to her, and doesn't attack unprovoked... for the most part.

### Description
Dyo is an ashen-skin rock gnome wearing practical clothes with various breaks and rips. She has a constantly scowling face and only appears to force a smile when spilling blood with her trusty greataxe that's kept on her at all times. A bag caked with dirt and various questionable substances is slung around her shoulder. Despite it's size, Dyo claims this bag holds all her possessions.

Please don't get in the way of Dyo when she's in combat.

### Nuova

Dyo, along with her companions from Nuova, were part of special forces and were to set sail towards Drachend and destroy guard posts along the coast to assist in the planned Nuova invasion. Instead, once the party arrived the sun broke and the falling pieces destroyed all the other ships and killed all the other military personel. Frustrated by this rocky start, Dyo was determined to still make a name for herself and decided to join her companions in making their way towards the capital city.

The party made short work of a homeless cannibal and ended up killing the Maldova Family and Velvet, experiences that challenged Dyo's worldview greatly and allowed her to become more considerate, if only slightly. By playing the pan flute, one of the only items that reminds Dyo of her lost home, she successfully distracted the guards of a fortified wall while her companions snuck through underneath.

It is unknown what happened to her companions and her mission.

### Fly By Night

Dyo was sent a letter from the demon lord of the north By-Tor, an impressive feat considering Dyo was in the complete wilderness and gave no indications to anyone where she was located. Sensing an opportunity to once again attempt to make a name for herself after the failed Nuova invasion, as well as being irritated by the pure audacity of the letter and insulting manner By-Tor writes, Dyo accepted By-Tor's call to action and went to Solidago's workshop.

While Dyo hardly understands many of the tasks that By-Tor demands completed, she takes joy in the pure destruction and havoc they cause so she doesn't care what the "why" is. It's possible that By-Tor's requests of arson and indiscriminate murder has worsened Dyo's violent tendencies. Or perhaps a different force entirely is making her more frantic.

### Relationships
-Frath Brightwood: The paladin loyalist would get in Dyo's way rather often if her actions weren't deemed "correct". She doesn't miss his company.

-Nemia: A respectable Nuova companion that shares her taste for blood. Dyo doesn't completely dislike her.

-Mytharius Orthello Casimir II: While she despises his cowardice, Dyo has come to appreciate his mail services.

-Nero: After forcing her to make a promise to him before saving her life, Dyo dislikes the Roman.

-Jester Klatz: While initially respecting his murderous tendencies, Dyo looks down upon him for agreeing to let his arm be chopped off and running to the Gold Master.

-Down: Dyo dislikes Down because she lost to him at the tournament. She intends to force a rematch in the future.

-Everybody: More likely than not, Dyo dislikes you. It's nothing personal.
