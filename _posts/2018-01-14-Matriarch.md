## The Matriarch
Campaign: Ronin

### Description

A lovely woman in her mid-thirties, decked out in powerfully-charmed tattoos. While she appears human in appearance and form, she cannot be harmed by bullets or knives, and appears to hunt for sport. She appears to be obsessive both with playing with her prey and feeding on them, taking her time in stalking enemies and constantly licking blood off her nails. When desired, she can extend her nails into curling claws capable of shredding flesh.

In combat, she prefers to split up groups and pick off stragglers on her own time. Despite her nearly invincibility, she waits until an enemy has been left alone before making her appearance. Since she is not in any harm's way, she takes her time with her prey, often allowing them to escape but making her presence known to them. Her powers appear to be linked to both the tattoos lining her body and the black lotus drug she guards.

### Drifters

The Matriarch was the owner of the bank raided by the Ronin clan at the time the drifters were involved in their activities. During the raid, the Matriarch was alerted to the drifter's presence shortly before they reached the second floor. Rather than hide away or take action, the Matriarch ordered the guards to leave the building, but not before tying her up in her own safe and leaving the vault unlocked.

Felicia and Sora were the first to reach the vault, where a single red light illuminated the stash of Black Lotus hidden away in the bowels of the building. In the center of the room, the Matriarch was loosely bound and gagged, awaiting rescue. After a quick greeting, Felicia threw the bag of explosives beneath the Matriarch's chair and tentatively removed the gag of the woman. Springing into aciton, the Matriarch blew a cloud of Black Lotus dust into Felicia's face, rendering her blind, before gutting her with elongated, monstrous nails. Sora fled down the stairs, alerting the others to the danger, but was also cut open during his escape. 

As the remaining members of the Ronin pivoted to <a href="https://drifter-handbook.github.io/mastertokyo4" >finish their mission</a>, the Matriarch hunted them down throughout the building individually. After being lured out of the vault, Nox squared off briefly with the Matriarch before escaping up the stairs to finish the mission and rescue Sora and Felicia. The Matriarch followed the trail of Texas throughout the second story, eventually coming face-to-face with the man as he downed a large dose of Black Lotus. The Matriarch fought with him briefly before slamming his head into the bar and leaving him to die.

On the lower floors, the Matriarch attempted to grab Shiro as she crawled through the vents to escape. The last time the Matriarch was seen was when Nox grabbed Texas's unconscious body to escape in the car, where the Matriarch gently caressed his cheeks with her claws before letting him go.
