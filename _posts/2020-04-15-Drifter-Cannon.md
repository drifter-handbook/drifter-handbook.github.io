## Drifter Cannon
Campaign: Feast of Legends

### Personality

Drifter Cannon is usually a cheerful fellow, who uses his booming voice and enchanted bad puns to inspire his comrades and protect them from danger. Despite his normally agreeable attitude, Drifter Cannon may sometimes become unusually paranoid, looking behind his shoulder and muttering about some "secret police" that may be after him. While Drifter Cannon outwardly seems to go along with the Queen's plans like the other Drifters, his true motive is to take revenge on the government of Freshtovia for the slaughter and enslavement of the Machine people at the hands of Queen Wendy's secret police several decades ago.

After the fall of the Machine nation, Drifter Cannon fled to Freshtovia and secretly recorded observations on Queen Wendy's regime in his journal. He writes this journal from within his cannon-barrel mouth, allowing him to keep a hidden log of Freshtovia's activities. His current goal is to track down the locations and identities of the four heads of the Freshtovian secret police.

Since he is a cannon, there are many things that Drifter Cannon cannot do alone in his quest to overthrow the Wendy regime. He is willing to join forces with any allies who have similar goals, and hopes to inspire the people of Freshtovia to share his goal.

### Description

Drifter Cannon is a sentient cannon, hailing from the Machine nation located deep underground. He has a thick iron barrel and a wooden frame, along with two solid wooden wheels. He moves by rolling his wheels, and speaks from his cannon barrel by moving the iron tube like a mouth. He wears no clothing, since he is a machine, and if he stops moving, it would be difficult to tell that he's not just a normal cannon.

Drifter cannon, being made of iron and wood, is rather resistant to damage. However, he is slow and heavy, and additionally does not have hands or legs, making it impossible for him to perform melee attacks.

### Story

A machine named Cannon was forged in the caverns of the Machine nation, deep underground in the caverns of Freshtovia. There, sentient machines mine metal ore, assemble new machines and infuse them with magical energy to create more sentient machines. Cannon was one of these machines, and lived happily for several decades at the side of creator, the Old Ironcaster. Cannon's job was to launch explosive cannonballs at cliff walls to help with mining, and to protect his coworkers from harm with his enchanted voice.

One day while mining, a dense smoke filled Cannon's cave, blinding him and making it hard to breathe. By the time he escaped the cave, his home city was in ruins. Giant blue orbs of fire rained down upon the city, burning every house in sight. Shadowy figures dashed through the ruins, killing the fleeing civilians with jets of flame and stabbing them with deadly forks. The remaining survivors were loaded into carts and sent away by the hooded figures, with the unmistakable icon of a girl with bright red hair inlaid on their shirts.

Cannon had no choice but to flee, and followed a slave cart all the way to Freshtovia. When he reached Freshtovia, he found that the citizens of Freshtovia had no knowledge of the invasion and slaughter that had just occurred. In fact, they didn't even realize that he was one of the Machine people.

Since then, he has been making a living by traveling across the land, making a living by selling his top product called "Advantage," where he uses his enchanted voice to temporarily boost someone's physical abilities. He has also renamed himself Drifter Cannon, following the Machine nation's tradition of taking an adjective as your first name upon becoming an adult.

### Drifters

Drifter Cannon did not meet up with the drifters until after they had returned from the French-Fry forest. His first action was to work with the Drifters to rig a pig race during Queen Wendy's 50th-year festival. He covered himself with a pink blanket and pretended to be a pig in the race, winning them all a substantial amount of gold.

After that, Drifter Cannon joined the Drifters, even accepting a quest from Queen Wendy herself. Despite his outward acceptance of Queen Wendy's actions, he continues to record his observations on Queen Wendy's regime in his <a href="https://drifter-handbook.github.io/cannons_journal/page1">journal</a>, and plans to one day enact his plan to destroy her secret police and remove her from the throne.

### Relationships

- Reed: Seems to share his distaste towards Queen Wendy and her regime.

- Carol Baskins: Enjoys causing chaos, and seems like someone Drifter Cannon can agree with.

- Quart Tart: His loyalty to Freshtovia may put him in direct conflict with Drifter Cannon's goals.

- Herbert Muenster: Does not understand.
