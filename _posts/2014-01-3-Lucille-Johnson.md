## Lucille Johnson
Campaign: All

### Personality
A sadistic immortal who appears malicious towards the drifters, though not through an active sense. His apathetic nature causes him to become a sort of passive evil in the universe, unwilling to intervene in times of trouble and unable to comprehend the destructive situations which he delights in. Lucielle Johnson appears to be a playful immortal, tailing the drifters and expressing interest and enthusiasum in watching their decisions. While the extent of his power is unclear, he appears to be a proper god in this universe. Not only has Lucielle Johnson been passively involved in nearly every campaign from every time, but he also is never shown in a mood other than carefree, even when being threatened by the drifters. It is implied that Lucielle Johnson is one of the most powerful deities, and he appears to be at the top of the triune as well. While not openly aggressive towards the drifters, Lucielle Johnson will actively lead them into dangerous situations, drive the stakes up for them, and make passive threats against the group to lead them where he wants them to go.

### Mythos
Lucielle Johnson always appears in a beige coat and and hat. He appears to be either immune to magic, or has magic so powerful that all other spells are cancelled before they begin. Lucielle Johnson's magic has no apparent bounds. He has been shown with powerful conjuring magic as well as illusionary magic,  however it is also implied that he is omnipresent to some degree, and capable of masking his presence. Lucielle Johnson appears to tail the drifters around on their adventures. While he seldom intervenes, he appears to alter circumstances to make sure the drifters follow the path he has set and accomplish the missions he has set before them. Even though he is part of the triune, Lucielle Johnson is never shown to have any opinion towards Sunny or Mr.Smith, although those two appear wary of him at best. 

His sigil is the inverse of that of the drifters, with the two curling points of the sigil extending out of the circle rather than encircling within.

### Drifters
First appeared at the carnival, handing out newspapers to the Drifters. After placing the bomb in [Nero](/nero_fanfiction/chapter1.html)'s chest, he later appeared at the end of the quest, tipping his hat and thanking the drifters once they cleared out the carnival.

Lucielle Johnson later appeared as the barkeep for the Capital Vice Hotel, requesting the drifters go retrieve the baby on the top floor and bring it down. Upon completion of the quest, Lucielle Johnson intended to take the baby back, but after learning of his involvement at the captial, the group labelled the immortal as a sadist who could not be trusted, and instead took the baby to the church down the road.

Jumping worlds in the universe, Lucielle Johnson made a surprise appearance at Mt.Hood as the college student drifter attempted to run away from the observatory. Upon Lucielle Johnson's threat, the student returned and was killed. Lucielle Johnson also chided the remaining drifters who attempted to struggle against the alien's control, claiming that he had <a href="https://drifter-handbook.github.io/ire9" >given them a choice that they had turned away</a>, and leaving them to an eternity of torture before their death.

Following these instances, Lucielle Johnson's presence became an inevitable, if unseen, part of the drifters' journeys. 

During the Reborn arc, Lucielle Johnson showed up as sage in a beige cloak who sent the drifters to the Trial of Heroes yet again. 

In the Ashen Drifters arc, Lucielle Johnson (appearing as some sort of amalgamation of the triune), appeared to sell the drifters healing potions. Following their killing of the Chimera of Uln, Lucielle Johnson appeared to make threats against Schmee (for some reason), and held conversation with the drifters regarding their latest battles. Swordfrog, sworn enemy of Lucielle Johnson, attempted to kill Lucielle Johnson here to no avail.

The Chain Gang story was focused heavily on Lucielle Johnson, although this is the only story where not only does Lucielle Johnson appear to be unaware of who the drifters are, but also the only story where Lucielle Johnson does not flex his supernatural strength (leading many to believe this might have been an origin of Lucielle Johnson). During the story, Lucielle Johnson is revealed to be a travelling singer, hitchhiking from city-to-city. 

During the Ronin arc, Lucielle Johnson was the patriarch of the drifters' clan. Following the bank heist, Lucielle Johnson showed up to rescue the drifters, who were left stranded without a ride at the scene of the crime.

While Lucielle Johnson has not made a formal appearance yet in the Illumina Saga, he appears to have been the guildmaster who sent the drifters on their voyage to the new land.

In legend it is stated that Lucille has a passing interest in the culinary arts, and makes a mean thin crust pizza.
