The Aerondight Right, also known as the Right, is a strict order of tests that must be followed and completed in order to earn an Aerondight's service. The rules only apply if the Aerondight has no lord. If you want to invoke the Right it's proper to first ask if they have a lord, for invoking the right of a preoccupied Aerondight is a grave insult.


THE RIGHT


1. Aerondights only work for those who know to ask for the Aerondight Right. People who don't have the influence, affluence, or craftiness to acquire the knowledge of the Aerondights are not worthy of protection. This is the first test.

2. Aerondights only work for those that have made a name for themselves. If your name, title, bloodline, clan, or group is not recognized by the Aerondight prior to asking for the Aerondight Right, then you are not worthy of protection. This is the second test.

3. Aerondights only work for those that give the respect the Aerondights deserve. The Aerondights are allowed to leave if their lord ever attempts to intentionally abuse the Aeronight in any way. If you cannot swear to never attempt to harm the Aerondight then you are not worthy of protection. This is the third test.

4. Aerondights only work for those that give in return. The Aerondights are allowed one request that their lord-to-be must fulfill. The lord-to-be may attempt to sway the Aerondight to different requests or attempt compromises, but if the Aerondight is not interested in other options then that is their right. If you fail to grant their request then you are not worthy of protection. This is the fourth test.

5. Aerondights only work for those that they see as worthy. You must be able bring the Aerondight to their knees to be considered. This is the final test.

If all of these tests are completed and continue to be honored then you earned the right of an Aerondight's protection. They will serve you dutifully and to the best of their abilities for as long as you will them to or until either of you die.
