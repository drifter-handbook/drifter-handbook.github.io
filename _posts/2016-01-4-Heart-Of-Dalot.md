## The Heart of Dalot
Campaign: Illumina

### Details

A powerful and valuable emerald torn from King Dalot. It is crudely cut but shines a vibrant hue. Silver filigree has grown around it, forming leaves and bark patterns that appear to have occurred naturally. The gem radiates power, and has a warm glow about it. 


### Effect

Once per day the user may cast dispel magic. At the cost of the item, the user may choose to dispel any spell regardless of its level.

### Feats

This object appeared to give King Dalot his demigod status, as well as help him maintain the city of Dalot.

King Dalot allowed for the Drifters to take his heart willingly, sacrificing himself.

Sun tore the heart out of Dalot without hesitation.

The Heart of Dalot was used to open the door to the world beneath the city of Dalot.

Gifted to Reed Idtentson by the other Drifters, fulfilling Andel's promise, and fulfilling Reed's goal to acquire anti-magic.

This artifact has never been used by the Drifters.
