## Sebastian
Campaign: Fly By Night 

### Description

Sebastian is an ancient silver dragon who inhabits the far reaches of the North and serves as an instructor to many a young mage. Sebastian is the eldest of any visiting dragon to the Northern Keep, sporting centuries on even the closest companions of his. Thanks to his age, Sebastian has grown incredibly large, with an almost bull-like appearance tacked onto his normal draconic form. His silvery scales sometimes appear tarnished from age, and at other times as bright and brilliant as the fun. He sports a pair of dark blue curved horns that can gut a man if he so chooses, though Sebastian is seldom seen as a combatant. Sebastian is well versed in healing magics of a highest degree, and can shapeshift at will like most other dragons.

No, rather Sebastian is well known for his role serving alongside Snowdog in the protection of the far north. Through his age and wisdom, Sebastian has ammassed a large collection of clerical tomes which he's studied and perfected. In sharing land with the mortals, Sebastian provides his teachings to those who wish to become a cleric or a paladin, but his teachings are strict. While he is not an unkind teacher, most of his pupils will profess to him being a bit of a stuck-up and controlling teacher. All of his pupils will readily point out he has no faith in them. Despite these misgivings, Sebastian is still a very good teacher. The few who have failed his classes have gone on to pick up clerical magics later on in life, or they failed because they were murdered brutally out in the wilds of the far north. He considers this a good track record, regardless.

And it is impossible to speak of Sebastian without talking of his insaitable drinking habits. Every week the dragon dissapears at various points to fly down to Nida to fetch a drink. The bartender there provides him with ale since he is a well-paying customer, but the trouble the dragon wreaks is hardly worth the price. Luckily, Snowdog accompanies his errant dragon down to Nida in secret and keeps an eye on him, perhaps the only reason why the Gold Master allows such tomfoolery in-place.

### Drifters

The Drifters have met Sebastian a few times, often stopping by while he is drunk at the nameless tavern out in Nida. Savvy and Dyo in particular have formed a strong connection with the dragon, and Sebastian has confided in them about how much he is dissapointed in his students. While back in the far north, however, Sebastian often pretends as though he's never seen the Drifters before. Dyo continues to smuggle him alcohol rather frequently though, so they are on quite good terms when the time allows.

Sebastian also accompanied the Drifters out into the Misted Forest when they were seeking the fallen star pieces to bring back to the Chaotics. He was there under Snowdog's orders, but also warned the Drifters that his presence was not really allowed. Regardless, he followed them into the forest and made sure no demons ate them up in their first venture through the northernlands. After stealing the star pieces and fleeing from the Stien Ram, Sebastian took off with the heavy star piece as directed by the Drifters, growing to nearly his full size and startling the party before taking off. After making sure it was taken to safety, Sebastian then returned to fully heal the downed members of the party and escort them to safety.

Since then, Sebastian has shown up throughout various sessions, either as a bar patron or as a professor at his school. He's a bit distant with the Drifters due to his close affiliation with Snowdog, but he is quite friendly towards a few in the bunch.
