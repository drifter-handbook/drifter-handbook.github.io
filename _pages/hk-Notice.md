All members of the inter-dimensional criminal organization known as THE DRIFTERS are wanted for crimes including blasphemy, conspiracy, larceny, kidnapping, fraud, organ trading, drug trafficking, loitering, and mass murder and/or aiding and abetting the proceeding.

All known members have been observed to cross at least one inter-dimensional barrier (IDB). Members may cross IDBs without warning or knowledge. All Drifters are found to have a unique magical residue which is used for verification by the Lapis Eparchy.

WARNING: All members of the Drifters should be considered extremely dangerous. Anyone who is able to capture a member of the Drifters, either self-described or magically verified, will be rewarded 200,000 gold pieces.
