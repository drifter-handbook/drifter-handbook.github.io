## Deistic Drones
Campaign: Illumina

### Description

Undead creatures with parasitic infestations controlling their forms. The type of body possessed by the parasite can vary wildly, but hosts are typically humanoids at a late stage of decay. The drones encountered showed very distinct signs of being puppetted by something related to a specific immortal's power. All appear to be aggressive in nature, and show little intelligence or strength beyond being resiliant and unable to feel pain. They have no known drive or purpose, but will attack and kill on sight. Both drones have been shown capable of spreading and creating new hosts.

### Cal'Kadoth Variant

Found in the Upper World. Drones of this type have been seen mostly as humanoids, but also as minotaurs or worgs (possibly even the immortal Lord E'gal). These parasites appear as fleshy maggots, and can be transmitted by ingesting sea water (and through other, unknown means). These drones are easily killed, but more intelligent creatures can still put up a long fight. Cal'Kadoth's parasitic drones have distinct black and purple tentacles that sprout from their wounded or decaying flesh. 

### Baumen Variant

Found in the Old World. Drones of this type have currently only been seen as humanoids. The parasitic nest of the creature resides in the zombie's head, entangled by branches. While it is unknown how the parasites are created, it appears to have a heavy tie with the fauna local to the old world, and possible Baumen himself. Rather than blood, these creatures have tree sap holding them together. Unlike the Cal'Kadoth variant, the Baumen drones can only be killed with fire or beheaded (removing the parasite). Baumen's drones are driven away from brass metal, though it is unknown to what extent this goes.

### Drifters
First encounteredat the beginning of the Illumina saga in Northwatch, where Athil and Sun were set upon by the Cal'Kadoth drones on the outskirts of town. As time progressed within the island of Northwatch, the drones slowly overwhelmed the island. The corruption of the island, largely blamed on the parasites, spread as far as the princess and diety of Northwatch, consuming both.

From that point on, nearly every other creature encountered in the Illumina Saga has had a parasite of this nature. In the Upper World, all of these creaturse were Cal'Kadoth variants, slowly engulfing the land and killing all those within their grasp. Once the Drifters journeyed to the Old World in search of power to eradicate the parasites, they found themselves face-to-face with a new variant of the threat. 

Baumen's drones' first appearance was in a package meant to be delivered to the Good Doctor. When the package was broken, nearly twelve drones broke loose and attacked the party. In the fray, Cassiel was infected and incinerated on-spot by Rammstien. The Drifters took one of the dead drones back to the Good Doctor to exchange for a healing potion. Fearing that this would not be enough, the Drifters decided to take the live drones back to the Good Doctor as well. On Orro's suggestion, Kled dragged the tied up goblin merchant behind him as lure for the drones as the Drifters made their way back to the shop. 

Upon further inspection of the Good Doctor's office, it appeared as though the Good Doctor was responsible for experimentation, and possibly creation, of the Baumen drones, using a mysterious plant that dripped amber liquid into the parasitic nests of these creatures. It was in the office where several drones were hung by brass hooks, seemingly keeping them immobilized and cluing the drifters in the the possibility of using brass to repel the creatures.
