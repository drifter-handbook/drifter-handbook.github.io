## The May King

Campaign: Dog Days, One-Shots

### Personality

  Of strong body and stronger conviction, The May King devotes every fiber of his being to achieving his ends. A priest of a dying tree-god, he sees the artifice and irreverence of the modern age as an insidious plague upon the world; its foul pestilence having fooled victims into believing it a boon. Though, no victory won through subversion is a victory earned. Thus, the King is upfront, blunt to a fault, and rigid in his observance of his own code, refusing to use the “weapons of the enemy” even in the most dire of situations. He seeks to lead the world back to its roots, and do so by example.

  He is proud, confident, and prone to self-aggrandizement, but nevertheless is a compassionate and loyal ally. The May King would be the first to charge into battle, and would grandstand his ideology the whole way. He is strong because he is free, and it is the duty of the strong to empower the weak. All have a place under Baumen’s branches.

### Description

  The May King is a hulking figure, standing at nearly 7 feet, over 300 pounds and adorned head to toe in furs and flora. His gruff, ape-like face is accented by a thick brown beard and a perpetually mournful gaze. Atop his head sits the Crown of the Summer Moon, a wreath of bone and buds that commemorates his victory over a great covetous demon. The May King’s already dominating presence is only exacerbated by his weapon of choice. A massive, ornately decorated petrified wooden amphora, noosed by a cord of woven rope delivers a swift peace to any and all who flail against nature’s way.

### Drifters

  The King’s first encounter with the Drifters was under the alias of “The Coroner” at the Crowning of the Summer Moon festival in the North. Alongside a cast of other personalities, The King participated in a series of games to earn various powerful magical Crowns, culminating in a pageant of sorts for the final title. With a boisterous oration, the King won the final Crown by popular vote and achieved his first victory over the plague of Artifice.

  Some time later, he participated under his current name of The May King in the WWWWEEEE Wish in the Bank ladder match with the Drifters. Despite emerging victorious in a series of one on one bouts, without his trusty urn by his side, he was unable to claim the wish and save his god. Undeterred, he continues to wander the branches of Yggdrasil in search of a cure for the Ailing Oak.


### Relationships

- Rodger E. McDowel: Rodger appears cordial, but reeks of something sinister. It is unclear if his gods(?) guide him along the path of ancestry, but regardless, he is not someone to be trusted. 

- Crownthief Wartsmith: The covetous demon “defeated” by the King at the Crowning Festival. Slimy and underhanded, the King holds the toad-beast in seething contempt, though does admit to a stab of sentimentality for the first conquest on his pilgrimage.

- The Drifters: The rag-tag group of adventurers are exemplary of the world the May King seeks to create; each member filling their role in the face of the chaos of their diverse creeds and homes. While they may not all see eye to eye with him, they will understand his holy mission with time.
