## Ryyke, Voice of the Departed

Campaign: Illumina

### Personality

Ryyke is eccentric, even by drifter standards. Hailing from the sunbaked deserts of the Dirt Spire, she comes across as alien in both appearance and mannerisms. She has a deep reverence for both the living and the dead, each of which she interacts with regularly. This is because Ryyke is a necromancer. Unlike most nations, in the Dirt Spire, necromancy is a venerated and necessary craft. The boiling heat and vicious sandstorms make it very dangerous for the living to work outdoors. Instead, necromancers, or Gravewakers, such as Ryyke raise the dead as laborers to perform these duties instead 

Somewhere between a psychopomp, undertaker, and performance artist, Gravewakers help the spirits of the dead pass on to their next life. Her people believe that bodies are afraid of being without a soul, and will not let the dead pass on to their new body without a replacement. To both free the trapped soul and satisfy the body, artificial souls are created by Gravewakers  and gifted to the body. In thanks for being given new life, these risen corpses, called the Benedicted, serve their families by working their fields, repairing their homes, and tending to their sick and elderly. 

Because of her heritage and the vital role her work plays in her society, Ryyke is both confused and saddened by others disgust towards her craft. She has difficulty understanding why others would not want their dead to pass on or why they force their living work instead of play. While her quirky mannerisms and happy-go-lucky demeanor usually allow her to ignore the sideways glares, she has no patience for those that disrespect the dead or kill unnecessarily. Killing a body without freeing the soul is the most heinous act one can commit; murder damns a soul to a torturous prison and leaves the body unable to serve its master.

In spite of their cultural differences, Ryyke is always eager to make new friends with the locals while she travels. In casual conversation she is bubbly and curious, though can come across as a bit ditzy. Optimistic, eager,and selfless, she always seeks to help as many people as possible, though her unusual ideas about death often makes her definition of “help” dubious to others.


### Description

As a changeling, Ryyke’s appearance is a matter of whim, though she rarely chooses to leave her natural form. Tall and lanky with slick pale skin, she wears her purple antennae pulled back in a loose bun. By far her most striking feature, however, are her large balck compound eyes. Though they give her very astute vision and the ability to see light polarization, their unblinking gaze can often unnerve the more squeamish. Her long arms end in delicate six-fingered hands and each foot in two long fleshy toes which, due to their sensitivity to vibrations, are left uncovered by shoes. 

Ryyke’s preferred attire consists of a baggy black turtleneck sweater and purple sarong. Each garment is decorated with the circular patinated coins of her homeland, indicating her status as a Gravewaker. Her thick belt is adorned with the many accoutrements of her work, both practical and spiritual.  Like much of her garb, Ryyke’s knee-height laced footwraps are perpetually stained with mud and ash from rooting around in cemetaries for work.

Like the rest of her kind, Ryyke has rudimentary shapeshifting abilities, though these are limited to mainly shape and color. While she can mimic the appearance of nearly any humanoid creature, she cannot change her height or mass, and as such has difficulty passing for a different race. Due to these limitations, this ability is mostly used for her funerary performances or to fool enemies in combat by blending in with her entourage.

### Relationships

- Storyweaver: Something about this one seems off. Ryyke is never sure what he's thinking or, really even doing. His arrogant attitude and narrow minded views on her culture have caused her to regard Storyweaver with a mild aversion. Chadwick seems to like him though for some reason...

- Lady Parhelion: Both a talented fighter and musician, Ryyke has both a professional and personal respect for Lady Parhelion. As one of the few among her new companions that both has compassion in her heart and doesn’t seem utterly repulsed by her culture, Rykke hopes the two can become friends.

- Megurin: A disintegrated corpse can’t be benedicted. Megurin’s wanton use of highly destructive magic is deeply troubling to Ryyke. She is a sort of necessary evil for the party’s continued survival, though this is likely a rationalization to avoid becoming the next smoldering pile of ash on the ground...

- Sun: Sun is a sweet girl, if a bit headstrong, though something about her makes Ryyke uneasy. An omen of misfortune seems to flow in Sun’s wake, and while her homeland had little use for flippant gods and their fickle blessings, she feels it is her duty to assist the souls left behind. 

- Orro: Silly, but kind. His devotion to his craft is very admirable and his knowledge of the world will be a valuable resource to help Ryyke integrate better into this culture. She regards Orro with respect.

- Ferdinand: A latecomer to the group, Ryyke has not interacted with Ferdinand very much, though first impressions are positive. 

- Chadwick and the Benedicted Boys: A troupe of Benedicted assistants Ryyke has collected over her travels. She regards each as a close friend and is eternally grateful for their eternal service. Chadwick in particular inhabits the body of a close friend, and the two seem to share a slightly closer bond than the others. Lately though, he’s been acting strange, even for a reanimated corpse.
