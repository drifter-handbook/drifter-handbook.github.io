## Pang
Campaign: Wendy's

### Description

A creature with brittle bones and a canine-like appearance and personality. It is generally aggressive, and immune to all damage not caused by cutlery. Pangs typically hunt in packs of 2-3, and are not native to Freshtovia.

### Drifters

Reed and Quart Tart beat up a lot of these things with various spoons. Several minutes of their lives were wasted beating the pangs to death while bickering.
