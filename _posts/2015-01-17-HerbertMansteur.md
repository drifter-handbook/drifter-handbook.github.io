## Herbert Mansteur

Campaign: Feast of Legends

### Personality

Herbert Mansteur is a sweet, gentle man from the frozen south of the Deep Freeze. Always eager to help and make friends, those who meeting him in passing would likely describe him as avuncular and outgoing. However, this jovial demenor quickly falls away upon closer inspection.

### Description

Years of living in the Deep Freeze have honed Mansteurs body and practical skills, but have left him illiterate and somewhat ignotant of freshtovian etiquite. His tall, imposing figure is only further accentuated by the heavy tribal furs that halo his shaven head. His booming voice belies his reserved nature, though he often has difficulty controling its volume. 

### Story

Born into the pastoral life of a Deep Freeze hearder-hunter, Mansteur’s life was abruptly turned on its head when the Ice Jester rose to power. The cold wind swept through his village like a plague, killing everyone but young Herbert, whose father’s body shielded from the brunt of the blast. Orphaned and with no renewable food source in sight, Mansteur was left to feed on the frozen corpses of his livestock, and eventually, his former village mates. The decades of isolation and cannibalism broke the man’s psyche, and by the time he was prepared enough to escape the deep freeze with his life, he was little more than a quivering mass of muscle and madness.

Found by a family of noble wheat farmers on the outskirts of Freshtovia, Mansteur was slowly taught the Freshtovian language and reintegrated into society. While he learned their manners and dignified way of speaking, the trauma of his past invariably bubbled to the surface in bouts of psychotic ravaing. Once more exiled from his home after accidentally killing one of his hosts, Mansteur wandered to the capital of Freshtovia hoping the hustle and bustle of the city would help to drown out the cacophony of voices that assaulted his mind. 

Thanks to a chance encounter with a sentient cannon and a spicy fingered old man, Mansteur once again found a family to take him in. Now, he hopes, above all else, that this one won’t be taken away from him as well.


### Drifters

Abruptly adopted by a group of misfits calling themselves the Drifters, Mansteur has once again found a family, though his increasingly violent outbursts have made many of his companions wary. 

Using his considerable strength and (usually) pleasant manners, Mansteur has proven to be a valuable asset both in combat and in dealing with civilians. His dual ladle- maces are a force to be feared by Fry Fiends and Frystas alike.

While still desperate in his search for a cure, after being prophesied to soon meet his true love, Mansteurs default demeanor has notably improved.



### Relationships

- Drifter Cannon: Mansteur sees the pain in Drifter's eye(s?) and empathizes deeply, he too having lost family and friend tryants. Due to the animistic faith of his homeland, the idea of a sentient cannon is rather mundate to Mansteur. While chaotic and reckless, Drifter means well, and their shared pain has caused Mansteur to see the cannon as a close friend, whether the feeling is reciprocated or not.

- Quart Tart: The old wizard's unwavering faith in Queen Wendy directly contradicting his chaotic disposition have left Mansteur weary of Quart. He wishes no ill upon the Spicy Man and will do anything he can to aid him, but intends to keep his distance when possible. Secrets are dangerous, especially in the presence of... eavesdroppers.

- Reed Idtentson: Reed is a cruel man with no honor or kindness in his heart. 

- Carol Baskins: Pretty Kitty. :)

- Queen Wendy: Having lived through the conquest and enslavement of the Deep freeze by the Ice Jester, Mansteur is wary of great rulers such as Wendy. Aboslute power corrupts absoultely, and if the words of Drifter Cannon are anything to go by, Wendy must be very powerful indeed. Still, he hopes that by earning the favor of one tyrant, he may be able to free his people from another.

- The Ice Jester: His tribe had words for beings like the Ice Jester, though none of them can be uttered witout bringing great and terrible curses upon oneself. He is evil incarnate, and Mansteur will go to any lenghts to free the Deep Freeze from the Jesters frozen clutches.
