## Deck of Many Familiars
Campaign: Fly By Night

### Details

A powerful relic created by Bytor and gifted to Down. Each card appears to have been made out of a brittle glass. Through the card, you can see small creatures clawing at the surface in an attempt to escape. When activated, the card is smashed against the ground and releases the creature within. Returning the creature reforms the card and places it back into the deck.


### Effect

Summon:
User can summon any demon from their deck (one at a time) for 1 action. When summoned, the demon will obey the user's orders exactly. Only one version of a demon can exist at a time. When a demon is killed, it is returned to the deck and can be summoned back next turn.

Coin Mimic (lv 1): A small demon that perfectly resembled a gold coin when resting. At the user's command, the mimic will break its guise and attack the closest person for 1d4 damage. It's not very smart.

Remoraz (lv 2): A centipede-like creature that lays perfectly still. It seems very hungry, and anything it swallows begins to melt in its stomach. It's still very young. Spits burning acid at its enemies for 1d6 damage.

Executioner's Axe (lv 1): An enchanted silver blade. When weilded by a silver hand, the user gains advantage on non-combat chopping actions (such as breaking down doors or walls).

Paper Crane (lv 1): Summons a Paper Crane monster as an ally.

Trap Card (lv 1): Summons a Snaptrap creature that acts as a trap. Snaptraps can burrow into the ground and hide in loose terrain.

Sheep (lv 1): Summons a normal sheep.

Restored Relic:
This artifact cannot be destroyed.

Blue Bane (Lv. 4):
The bearer of this artifact has +4 to hit and +4 damage against any Blue enemies.

### Feats

The creatures within appear to be lesser demons collected by Bytor.

Crafted and corrupted by Bytor, as a gift to Down.
