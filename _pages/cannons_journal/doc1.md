## Mysterious Note

A mysterious note that appeared inside this journal overnight. It reads as follows:

<i>
Dear Drifter Cannon,

We sentient metal beings should stick together.

Lead the revolution, comrade.
</i>

### Drifter Cannon's Comments

This note suddenly appeared in my journal. No one could have possibly sneaked it in by normal means, since my barrel was shut the entire time. The author of this note appears to be friendly, since if they had ill intent, they could have easily gotten me arrested by now.

Following the appearance of this note, it appears some entity has been magically assisting me through my journal. Since then, several pages containing details on a group of people called the "Drifters" have temporarily appeared in (and later disappeared from) this journal.

While these pages are interesting, they do not help me in achieving my current goals. These pages seem to describe entirely different worlds, and I do not know of any man named Swordfrog or girl named Savvy. Until I meet these people, it appears this information will be of little use.
