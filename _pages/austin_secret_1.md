Somewhere between a psychopomp, undertaker, and performance artist, Gravewakers help the spirits of the dead pass on to their next life. The people of Veiligheid believe that bodies are afraid of being without a soul, and will not let the dead pass on to their new body without a replacement. To both free the trapped soul and satisfy the body, artificial souls are created by Gravewakers and gifted to the body. In thanks for being given new life, these risen corpses, called the Benedicted, serve their families by working their fields, repairing their homes, and tending to their sick and elderly.
