## Demon's Flute
Campaign: Fly By Night

### Details

A powerful relic created by By-Tor and gifted to Dyo. The pipes are dented and rusted, held together by a black cord. Only one of the pipes appears to produce any sound. When activated, the cord holding the flute together melts into a tar-like substance which is extremely hot to the touch.


### Effect

Ranna (Lv 2):
As an action, the user can cast Sleep on any single enemy without expending any spellslots or requiring the spell in the user's spelllist. However, if the spell succeeds, an ally will fall asleep as well (decided by the DM). If the spell fails to put any enemies to sleep, both the targeted creature(s) and an ally are silenced for one turn (decided by the DM).

Dyrim (Lv 2): 
As an action, user can cast Friends on any non-hostile unit without expending any spellslots or requiring the spell in the user's spelllist. However, if the spell succeeds, the target loses a set amount of health (decided by the DM) after the spell wears off.

Gadget Bead (Lv 2): +2 on Investigation checks to determine what a mechanical object/creature does. Forging any simple weapon will imbue it with basic perks for being high quality.

Blooddrinker (Title) (Lv. 2): Dyo is classified as a Lesser Demon. In addition, when Rage activates, Dyo can unleash her snake form. If she activates this form, enemies and allies that can see Dyo roll a Charisma save (DC 10). On fail, that creature is Frightened for 1 turn.

Cosmic Rage: By burning 2 instances of Rage, Dyo can enter Cosmic Rage. Cosmic Rage works similar to regular Rage, except Magic damage is halved rather than physical damage.

Restored Relic:
This artifact cannot be destroyed.

Blue Bane (Lv 4):
The bearer of this artifact has +4 to hit and +4 damage against any Blue enemies.
