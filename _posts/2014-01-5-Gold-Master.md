## The Gold Master
Campaign: Ronin, Supermarket, Fly By Night

### Description

The Gold Chaotic, who has no say in any matter in Nida, yet stakes his claim in the entirety of the city. He is always depicted enshouded in black robes, heavily embroidered with metallic threads. His motives are unknown, beyond his greed. His face is seldom seen, and conflicting accounts are given. He is identified, instead, by his weapons and his hands: one dipped in silver, and the other in gold. There is no pattern on either hand, nor any imperfection in the coating, and they move silently. Guildmaster supposedly resides in Nidavellir and controls the town, though none will admit it. While mysterious, Guildmaster is portrayed as a very proud man.


### Mythos

Little is known about Gold Master and his relation to the Chaotics, beyond his acts among them. The first story of him recounts of his attack on the monastery in which the Red Monk was raised. This was the first encounter between them when they were children, and no one knows who won the ensuing fight. All they know is that afterwards, the theif and the monk made their peace and set out together to find the North.  

Guildmaster wields the yellow disgraced blade. It stands at five feet tall, and holds one soul. Through no discernable means, he is also able to control a storm of needles. Most confrontations with Guildmaster begin with a needle against the questioner's eye. In wartime, he was known for walking into battles casually with five hundred needles flurried around him, reducing anyone in the way to a bloodied pulp.

Though considered the weakest of the Chaotics, the Gold Master is also the most irrational. Whereas The Snowdog is guided by what is right, Bytor by his bloodlust, and Aster by his judgement… the Gold Master's wants and needs change constantly. As such, he has a high level of attendants who serve him in secrecy. These people can be anyone, since the Gold Master's whims can change and align with even the most devout man's quest. Some say his secrecy is a front, but others believe he hides secrets from the other Chaotics and makes himself lowlier than he truly is.

He has two children. Nothing is known about them besides their masks of the silver rat and the gold cat. They fight with the Nine.

### Drifters

The Gold Master chose Texas to represent him amongst the Drifters. It is also known that Solidago, the woman who creates the portals which bring the Drifters to the North, serves the Gold Master and aligns her wishes with his. His true location, however, is unknown.
