## Stables of the Northern Keep
Campaign: Fly By Night

### Geography
A small but well-kept stables building near the heart of the Northern Keep. Lord Snowdog and the Scholars of the Northern Lights keep several types of creatures within the stables, all of which are highly capable of traversing the difficult terrain of the far north. The stables are one of the few warm areas of the city, and are one of the few wooden structures throughout the entire Northern Keep. The back enterance of the stables leads to a cave with direct access to the tundras outside the city, where the stables' larger inhabitants reside and guard.

Besides the named mounts below, the stables are home to several Clydsdale horses and Winter Wolves. The horses are more plentiful than the wolves, but are seldom used due to their difficulty to keep alive in the harsh weather. Horses are typically used while travelling to warmer regions, and are excercised often due to their disuse. The Winter Wolves are used more commonly by Lord Snowdog's soldiers, but are considered to be themselves soldiers as well. They serve Lord Snowdog in exchange for lodging, food, and occasionally wealth, but are mercenaries who can come and go by their own right.

### Occupants of Interest
- Bayden: Also known as the Magekiller, Bayden is the leader of the Winter wolves, and is the largest by a noticible degree. He is supposedly a decendent of Fenrir, though Lord Snowdog claims otherwise. Unlike most of the other Winter Wolves, Bayden can understand most languages, including Common. While he is clearly a capable fighter, Bayden has a fierce temper that has only just begun to mellow out with age. In his youth, any magic-user who rode him into battle wound up dead, earning him his nickname. In recent years though, Bayden has become a highly reliable mount, and seems to care deeply about undoing his questionable reputation with mages in the past.

- Lilium: An underground pathway leading to the castle. Full of monsters and difficult to navigate. A giant, magical white rat acts as a guide to any travelling to the castle via the sewers.

- The Capital's Castle: A large, looming rock structure on the northern side of town. The castle is home to the king and the princess, as well as several high-ranking knights, nobles, and hundreds of staff. The castle is also notable to having many secret passageways throughout its interior, and reaching out to the inner layer of the city.
