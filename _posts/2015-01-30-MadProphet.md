## Herbert Mansteur, The Mad Prophet

Campaign: Feast of Legends

### Personality

Herbert Mansteur is a sweet, gentle man from the frozen south of the Deep Freeze. 

### Description

Years of living in the Deep Freeze have honed Mansteurs body and practical skills, but have left him illiterate and somewhatignotant of freshtovian etiquite. His tall, imposing figure is only further accentuated by the heavy tribal furs he dons.

### Story

This is where your known backstory goes

### Drifters

And this is anything that's happened in ur life since you became a drifter.


### Relationships

- Drifter Cannon: Mansteur sees the pain in Drifter's eye(s?) and empathizes deeply, he too having lost family and friend tryants. Due to the animistic faith of his homeland, the idea of a sentient cannon is rather mundate to Mansteur. While chaotic and reckless, Drifter means well, and their shared pain has caused Mansteur to see the cannon as a close friend, whether the feeling is reciprocated or not.

- Quart Tart: The old wizard's unwavering faith in Queen Wendy directly contradicting his chaotic disposition have left Mansteur weary of Quart. He wishes no ill upon the Spicy Man and will do anything he can to aid him, but intends to keep his distance when possible. Secrets are dangerous, especially in the presence of... eavesdroppers.

- Reed Idtentson: Reed is a cruel man with no honor or kindness in his heart. 

- Carol Baskins: Pretty Kitty. :)

- Queen Wendy:
