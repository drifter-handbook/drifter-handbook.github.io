## Wendy
Campaign: Hadal Keep, Wendys

### Personality
Someone who always is looking for information or an angle, happy to stick to the shadows and observe or step into the limelight if it suits her whims.

### Description
A taller refined woman appearing to be in her mid twenties, more lithe than strong but not afraid to get her hands dirty. Incredibly charismatic, many who talk to her often find themselves doing favors or spilling information they hadn't intended to.

### Story
Wendy was born the youngest of two Daughters to Emperor Dave, ruler of Freshtovia. Born in the palace with many servants her early life was quite easy, and she watched as her father had finished uniting the territory after multiple incursions from the Ice Jester to the south. Quickly taking to the politics of running a kingdom the young princess was respected in the court and by many of those outside the walls as she grew, helping guide Freshtovia into the future.

As she aged she began to chafe at some of the old laws and ways as well as watching rot slowly begin to enter into the Kingdom after her fathers work, and took a heavy handed approach to ensuring the kindgom remained stable. This caused her to lose some favor with her father while her sister began to make a name for herself, negotiating a number of high profile deals with other nations to the west. Never the less Wendy kept pressing for more and more difficult assignments, though she was often forced to stay inside the capital city even as the enemies of Freshtovia gained strength as she was embroiled deep within the factions of the court.
