### Description

The latest upstart detective agency in the Kyoto area; non-profitable but not by choice, and sponsored by Lucielle Johnson. The agency runs out of a small office located above a decent ramen shop, with a single flight of stairs leading up to the second floor. The office is torn and disrepaired, barely maintained, and crowded to an unpleasant degree. The entire office suffers from a surplus of furniture, with seven desks crammed into the small space, as well as several bookshelves, filing cabinets, and a couch. On top of that, papers and computers fill most available surfaces, typically unsorted but occasionally filed properly by Noriko. 

The agency has a few notable features, namely a black cat called "Space Jam" who lives in the building when Noriko has to work late shifts. The agency also has a namesake mini-fridge that sits on her desk, filled with various people's spoiled lunches and a few jars of Space Jam.

### Drifters 

An offshoot of the Drifters run and maintain the detective agency, being the late-shift for the office and taking in the majority of the "interesting" jobs that the agency recieves. Most of the drifters who work this shift consider the office a second home, as funds are tight and the work gets long. Noriko runs most of the agency, handling not only the necessary paperwork for keeping the place afloat but also working with Retfird to keep up communications with clients. Retfird's assistant, Carol, takes care of him at the office and helps with transportation to other locations.

Orro and Carrie are newer hires to the company, working to flesh out the agency with different specializations. Orro boasts heavy acedemic skills and scientific backgrounds, making his debut as a forensic scientist for the firm. Carrie provides both security and handyman skills, showing dedication both for the law and for the firm's ability ot circumvent it. Both oversee and assist Retfird and Noriko, as well as their intern Akemi.

While work was lacking for quite some time, the firm's representative, Tenzin, was able to acquire some leads regarding subway accidents. The drifters set out to investigate these rumors, tracking the trail of a woman who had supposedly gone missing on those lines.
