## Lady Starlight

Campaign: Fly By Night

### Personality

The powerful ruler of the Northern Keep, Lady Starlight is a sorceress who should never be trifled with. Lady Starlight is a stern and intelligent queen to her small kingdom, and often referred to as the true ruler of the North due to her husband's absences. Her ability to stay calm under pressure and evaluate the situation is what earns her the respect of her peers, alongside her strong tactical skills and brilliant sorcery. Her power and skill comes at cost though, often stretching her to her limits and making her irritable. She is pre-emptive with assuming who will be a future problem, and likes to nip things in the bud before they create more work for her. Despite her snappy nature and intimidating presence, she still maintains a strong level of compassion and kindness for her people and her family, even if it comes out in indirect ways.

### Description

Lady Starlight is an older human woman who appears to be aging quite well. Her most notable feature is her long black hair, a vertitable mane which stretches down to her heels and is quite well-maintained. She's quite fond of silver jewelry, and keeps her enchanted jewelry all over her person at all times. Despite the cold temperatures of the North, Lady Starlight typically wears long, dark dresses with hanging sleeves, and wears no winter garb. Even in battle, Lady Starlight forgoes armor in favor of wearing garments that are easier to cast spells in.

Lady Starlight always runs into battle astride her black unicorn, Lilium, who serves as a magical conduit, a dangerous magical ally, and also generally a good mount. Lady Starlight is quite protective of Lilium, and spends quite a bit of her freetime around the unicorn. Lady Starlight and Lilium make a terrifying combo in combat, serving as the cornerstone of Snowdog's army. Lady Starlight's protective charms are always up and always powerful, and her aggressive magics are even stronger, raining down showers of meteors on the opponent or simply decimating their minds. She is virtually untouchable on the battlefield due to her sorcery, and a sure sign of death for the enemy who spots the rider approaching.

### Story

Lady Starlight was born in the same realm as the Chaotic Lords, and lived nearby to Snowdog as he lived in the elven settlements. She and her sisters lived a largely peaceful life, spending most of their time being groomed into being ladies-in-waiting. Most of her days were spent out in the sunny spots of the forest, idly being groomed into service and waiting to serve what she believed to be her purpose among the elven clans.

One morning, while out with her sisters, Lady Starlight came across a pure white unicorn, and sought to ride it, as unicorns only allow the purest of heart to ride them. Before she could successfully mount the unicorn, however, a camoflouged Snowdog shot and killed the beast. Lady Starlight pursued and nearly beat the living daylights out of Snowdog before he pointed out that the unicorn had made no sound while trotting around, and was actually the shapeshifter beast he'd been pursuing for the past week. Upon inspection of the corpse, the unicorn was indeed proven to be a different monster entirely, though Lady Starlight was not particularly exactly sated by this revelation.

Regardless, Lady Starlight thanked Snowdog, but was still quite angry with him. Snowdog fell head over heels for the woman, and sought to win her love with no luck. After years of being spurned, he finally quested out and after several months, returned with a young black unicorn colt for Lady Starlight to have as an apology. With the original situation resolved, Lady Starlight finally began to tolerate Snowdog's courting, and was genuinely moved by the gift. Slowly, the two grew closer, and as Snowdog made attempts to show off his hunting prowess, Lady Starlight began learning magic to foil his displays of skill. Inadvertendly, the elves discovered Lady Starlight's natural talent for magic through this, as well as her intense dedication to honing her skills. Lady Starlight refused formal teaching, but became a naturally powerful sorcerer through practice with the elves.

After demons tore through the forest, Snowdog was left without family and friends, and many of Lady Starlight's people had been wiped out as well. Snowdog sought out Lady Starlight and begged her to join him on their journey out of the realm, and Lady Starlight agreed to relocate with the rest of the Chaotic Lords. Together, they travelled to the North and left their old lives behind.

Lady Starlight helped establish the Far North and played a pivotal role in driving out the immortals from the North, as well as ending the war between the Frost Giants and the Silver Dragons. She eventually married and settled down with Snowdog in the Northern Keep. Snowdog kept his desire to return to the wild though, whereas Lady Starlight wished to stay and develop what they'd created. The two eventually came to an agreement where Snowdog would be allowed to return to his beast form and wander about, where Lady Starlight would take control over the domain and rule. 


### Drifters

Lady Starlight is the ruler of the Far North, and while Snowdog typically greets the Drifters while up there, Lady Starlight typically handles most of the plannings and supplies that go into their missions. 

Lady Starlight first played a larger role in Fly By Night when the Drifters were tasked with fending off By-Tor's monthly attacks on the keep. She provided tactical insight, mission review, and answered questions for the party before they departed. Before taking off herself to go fight against By-Tor, she used a magical powder to temporarily change Dyo's alignment to Lawful Good, so that she wouldn't cause any further trouble within the Keep.

"Savvy" also tries desperately to convince Lady Starlight that she's Starlight's daughter, to which Lady Starlight neither denies nor particularly encourages. 

During the fall of the North, Lady Starlight single-handedly leads the defense of the Northern Keep, keeping its defenses up and ensuring that it survived, despite Snowdog's absence. 


### Relationships

- Snowdog: Lady Starlight's husband. While they are very different people, they seem to hold a great love for one another. They both prefer to keep to themselves.

- Lady Parhelion: Lady Starlight's only daughter. They have a very strained relationship. While Lady Parhelion was raised by Lady Starlight for the first few years of her life, she went to go live with Snowdog for quite a long time out in the wilderness. Not only was Lady Parhelion heavily injured as a child from the experience, but she also returned lacking the ability to read, speak, and without most forms of basic education. Lady Starlight worked hard to reform Lady Parhelion into a respectable scholar post-return, and made great success, but Lady Parhelion largely despises the role which her mother has attempted to force her into. Lady Parhelion's desire for freedom and to follow in her father's carefree ways often conflict with her mother's desires to groom a respected sorceress and ruler, and the two fight often.
