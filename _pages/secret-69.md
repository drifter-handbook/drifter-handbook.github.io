## Snows the Skeleton
Campaign: ???

### Description

The Blue-Eyed Skeleton, defender of the Underground and leader of Snowing Town. He is well-armed, owning many immensely powerful laser blasters as well as his mighty bones. Beyond this, Snows also wears a magical blue sweatshirt which allows him to teleport. He wove the sweatshirt together over three years, sewing together monster pelts and imbuing his strongest memes into their furs. They say he spends more time in that sweatshirt than any other clothing, and that his appearance never changes from year to year no matter what he wants to looks like. While humorous, he is often also portrayed as a genius.

### Mythos

The last of the Skeleton Brothers to be called to arms. He fights for the protection of life, and the pursuit of knowledge, but most importantly to keep the Player at bay. Raised as a lowly skeleton, Snows often harasses his enemies by ambushing them with puns, and seldom returns to his home. He rules Snowing Town but only oversees the Skeleton Brothers. The rest of the enclave is run by his brother, Cyperus.

Snows wields two types of bones, all of his own making. The first is the blue disgraced bone. It stands at four feet, and it only kills those that are moving. The second type is the white bone, the King of all Bones. It is a powerful bone, able to kill any target. As of the past two years, he has not used it.

Snows is a funny and understanding skeleton, and the most forgiving of the Skeletons. However, he is also the most regretful, and the one with the most to lose. He appears the most human of the Skeletons, but is considered the most dangerous because of it. Snows's greatest strengths lie with his aid from his allies and his people, and his ability to think quickly and cheat in every battle. He is undefeated in every regard, even against the Player demon. The few failures he has seen have yet to come to fruition.

He has one brother, Cyperus, who also lives in Snowing Town.
