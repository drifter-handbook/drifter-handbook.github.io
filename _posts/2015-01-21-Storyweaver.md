## Storyweaver
Campaign: Illumina

### Personality
Storyweaver had very few interactions so far, but from what can be inferred it seems that he is goal-oriented. He values his fellow crew members and the drifters on board, and plays an active role in assisting them in a fight. Despite his current initial quiet nature, Storyweaver is very invested in the motives and thoughts of everyone else and has plans to uncover those thoughts for his own personal interest.

### Description
The divination wizard appears to both have incredible and zero fashion sense. While the individual pieces of attire are well-crafted and stylish, the combination of all the items is taxing on the eyes. He uses his two wands as knitting needles.

### Story
Not much is yet known about Storyweaver beyond he was gaining passage to the mainland by assisting the drifter group. Storyweaver is not his real name; Whenever anyone asked his name, the wizard would tell the person he is just a story weaver.

### Drifters
Storyweaver met the current drifter group on their ship, The Driftwood. He was tasked to assist on the water, per the request of Ashell, in order to gain passage to the mainland. At the "get to know people" dice game he immediately sat out after rolling dice values that added up to the unlucky number 13, as he takes warning signs seriously.

When a storm appeared on the horizon, Storyweaver quietly cast an illusion to make the sky appear perfectly sunny so the group would continue onwards towards the mainland without any delay. This proved to be a poor decision because the weather wasn't the group's only obstacle. Pirates appeared on the horizon and started attacking The Driftwood after the drifters refused to hand any valuables over. Storyweaver spent most of his time analyzing the situation and current status of The Driftwood, and after hearing fighting ran up to the top deck, where Orro was running away from a fight and leaving one of their dragonborn crew to fend for themselves. Disgusted by his blatant lack of bravery and loyalty, Storyweaver pushed past Orro and cast spells to quash the enemies on deck and save his crew member.

### Relationships
-Tasma: Tasma and Storyweaver shared a tense interaction on The Driftwood before parting ways. They seem to know each other but the nature of their relationship is unknown.
