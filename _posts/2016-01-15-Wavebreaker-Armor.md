## Wavebreaker Armor
Campaign: Fly By Night

### Details

A set of heavy plate armor, carved from the bones of the great dragon turtle Aamon and hung with woven red fabrics. The armor consists of a segmented chest piece, sash, collar, two pauldrons (detachable), and a heavy mail coat that lays beneath the chestpiece, and continues along the back, wrapped with segmented bone plates from the navel down along the tailcoat. No metal exists in the entire armor set, even the clasps and custom mail beneath the armor is made of bone. A sigil rests in the center of the armor depicting two waves curling inwards, parted by a trident. When water makes contact with the armor, the bone heats up and glows teal in a strange fashion, preventing its wearer from coming in contact with any sort of seawater.


### Effect

Functions similar to plate mail, with the following bonuses:

Dry As A Bone: When passing through water, or whenever water moves within 5 ft. of the armor, Gloria can choose to evaporate all water within a 5ft sphere. When an entity makes contact with the steam produced by this ability, they take 2d8 fire damage until the steam disperses. This damage is ignored completely if the entity has fire resistance.

Paragon: Your base strength bonus is added to your charisma bonus, and vice versa.

### Feats

Crafted by Preston and Logan, and created for the paladin Gloria, as requested prior to her battle with Speilascor. The Wavebreaker Armor features no metal components due to Speilascor's ability to destroy metal with his song. The bones used in the piece were scavanged by Logan in the plane of Water. Aamon had been dead nearly three thousand years prior to his bones being harvested, having died from a bad wager amongst friends, and long since rotten away.
