## The Twin Amulets of Hogwash Swamp
Campaign: Driftwood

### Details

A set of large amythest gems infused with powerful magic. The gems have been slightly polished and inlaid in a crude silver holder. The silver chain attached to the piece is only short enough to be a choker, and cannot be removed.


### Effect

Spectre (Lv1): When activated, the weilder becomes phantasmal and can move through objects for a few seconds. The weilder immediately fails a death saving throw whenever this ability is triggered.


### Feats
Placed on the bodies of the slain twins of Bogwash Swamp in the Mad Mage's tower. Taken by Lady Parhelion during the duel of Orro and Lord whatshisface.
