## Ryyke, Voice of the Departed

Campaign: Illumina

### Personality

Ryyke is eccentric, even by drifter standards. Hailing from the sunbaked deserts of the Dirt Spire, she comes across as alien in both appearance and mannerisms. In casual conversation, she is happy-go-lucky, a little bit ditzy, and very devoted to her work.

### Description

As a changeling, Ryyke’s appearance is a matter of whim, though she rarely chooses to leave her natural form. Tall and lanky with slick pale skin, she wears her purple antennae pulled back in a loose bun. By far her most striking feature, however, are her large balck compound eyes. Though they give her very astute vision and the ability to see light polarization, their unblinking gaze can often unnerve the more squeamish. Her long arms end in delicate six-fingered hands, good for more intricate tasks but lacking in grip strength. Each foot possesses two long fleshy toes which, due to their sensitivity to vibrations, are often left uncovered by shoes. 

Ryyke’s preferred attire is a baggy black turtleneck sweater, decorated with the circular patinated coins of her homeland indicating her status as a Gravewaker. Her purple sarong too bears these coins with the addition of many accoutrements of her work, both practical and spiritual.  Her knee-height laced footwraps are perpetually covered in mud and other refuse from rooting around in cemetaries.
