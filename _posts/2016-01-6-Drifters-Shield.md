## Blade of the Apothecary
Campaign: Fly By Night

### Details

A powerful relic restored by the Red Monk and gifted to Nero. This large shield is polished and repainted, though there are still clear signs of damage and dents. Despite its large size and stature, it is surprisingly light. When activated, the shield creates phantom images of itself to surround and protect allies.


### Effect

Steadfast (Lv 1):
As an action, the bearer can activate a special "shield" stance. This stance adds +3 to the user's AC, and the user can share their AC with one adjacent person/object for a turn of combat.

Restored Relic:
This artifact cannot be destroyed.

Gold Bane:
The bearer of this artifact has +2 to hit and +2 damage against any Gold enemies.

### Feats

Originally used by Nero in the Highway Drifters arc, but destroyed.

Found and restored by the Red Monk, as a gift to Nero.
